Blooket CSV Format Specification for LLMs (v2.0 – Guaranteed Import-Safe)
How to Generate Perfect Blooket Import Files for Teachers

OVERVIEW

Blooket accepts quiz questions via CSV upload.
This document provides strict rules for LLMs to produce Blooket files that will import without errors or silent row deletion.
All text output must be ASCII-safe.

CSV FILE STRUCTURE

REQUIRED Format:

File Type: CSV

Encoding: UTF-8

File extension: .csv


REQUIRED ROW STRUCTURE:
ROW 1 (The Dummy Row):
Blooket Import Template,,,,,,,
(Note: This text goes in column 1. Include 7 commas to maintain the 8-column structure. Blooket will ignore this row.)
ROW 2 (The Headers - Must Match Exactly):
Question #,Question Text,Answer 1,Answer 2,Answer 3,Answer 4,Time Limit (sec),Correct Answer(s)
ROW 3+ (The Data):
1,Question Text,Answer,Answer,Answer,Answer,20,1
ASCII-ONLY RULES (CRITICAL)

Blooket fails or drops rows if non-ASCII characters are used.

LLMs must output ASCII-only text.

Replace all:

Curly quotes (“ ”) -> "

Curly apostrophes (’) -> '

Em dashes (—) -> -

En dashes (–) -> -

Ellipses (…) -> ...

Accented characters -> unaccented equivalents (example: Seguin not Seguín)

Bullet points -> hyphens or plain lines

Any other Unicode punctuation -> plain ASCII

Forbidden:

Emojis

HTML

Markdown

Non-ASCII characters of any kind

Line breaks inside a cell

COLUMN-BY-COLUMN SPECIFICATION

Column 1: Question #

Integer

Sequential starting at 1

No text

Column 2: Question Text

ASCII-only

If ANY punctuation appears (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in double quotes (escape quotes by doubling)

Punctuation is welcome for clarity; quoting is for CSV safety, not to discourage use. Underscores (and hyphens) are safe even unquoted, but quoting them is fine for consistency.

No quotes unless escaped correctly

Prefer short single-sentence questions with no trailing period

Recommended max length 200 characters

Preferred examples:
What is the main idea
How do robots help workers
What does the poem show

Columns 3-6: Answers

ASCII-only

If ANY punctuation appears (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in double quotes (escape quotes by doubling)

Punctuation is welcome for clarity; quoting is for CSV safety, not to discourage use. Underscores (and hyphens) are safe even unquoted, but quoting them is fine for consistency.

1 to 10 words recommended

Answers must be similar in length

Must include at least Answer 1 and Answer 2

Answer 3 and 4 may be left blank (but columns must exist)

Do not use HTML, symbols, or special punctuation

Column 7: Time Limit (sec)

Integer between 5 and 300

Recommended: 20

Column 8: Correct Answer(s)

Use 1-based indexing (1, 2, 3, or 4)

For multiple correct answers, wrap in quotes, example: "1,3"

Never use 0-based indexing

CSV FORMATTING RULES

Punctuation

If ANY punctuation appears in a field (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in double quotes.

Underscores (and hyphens) are allowed/encouraged for code-like tokens; they do not require quotes, but quoting is acceptable.

Do not add spaces before or after the commas that divide fields. Spaces inside a field are fine when the field is quoted (e.g., "The dog barked at the cat, which made the cat jump."). Avoid accidental leading/trailing spaces unless intentional.

Quotes

If a field contains quotes, escape by doubling them.

Example:
"Print(""Hello"") outputs Hello"

No line breaks inside fields

One question per line only

Avoid long questions

Long questions increase the chance of punctuation errors or accidental Unicode characters.

PEDAGOGICAL GUIDELINES

Distractors must be:

Plausible

Relevant

Same topic family as the correct answer

Similar in length

Difficulty mix:

60 percent easy

30 percent medium

10 percent hard

Avoid giving away correct answers:

Keep all answer lengths within 20 percent of each other.

ANSWER DISTRIBUTION / ANTI-PREDICTABILITY

Track correct-answer slot usage to avoid predictable patterns:

- Keep a running count for Answer 1-4 as the correct slot; keep totals within 1 of each other.
- No slot may be correct more than 2 times in a row.
- Use every slot at least once by question 8 (or rotate 1 and 2 if only two answers are used).
- If a question has multiple correct answers, count the lowest-numbered correct slot toward distribution.
- After the CSV block, add one plain-text audit line (not part of the CSV file) showing counts and max streak, e.g.:
Answer slot usage (correct answers): A1=5, A2=5, A3=5, A4=5; Max streak=2

EXAMPLE OF A PERFECT BLOOKET CSV

Blooket Import Template,,,,,,,
Question #,Question Text,Answer 1,Answer 2,Answer 3,Answer 4,Time Limit (sec),Correct Answer(s)
1,What is the capital of France,Paris,London,Berlin,Rome,20,1
2,"What is the output of print(1, 2, 3)",1 2 3,123,Error,Nothing,20,1
3,Who wrote the play Hamlet,Shakespeare,Marlowe,Bacon,,20,1

OUTPUT PROTOCOL FOR LLMS

When generating a Blooket CSV:

Step 1: Confirm question count (default 20)
Step 2: Identify key concepts
Step 3: Write short ASCII-only questions
Step 4: Provide 4 answer choices when possible
Step 5: Set time limit (20 seconds recommended)
Step 6: Use correct answer index (1 to 4)
Step 7: Wrap any field containing punctuation in double quotes; double any quotes inside
Step 8: Validate entire file using the checklist below
Step 9: Track correct-answer slot counts while writing; avoid streaks > 2 and keep counts even
Step 10: After the CSV, print a one-line usage audit (outside the CSV)
