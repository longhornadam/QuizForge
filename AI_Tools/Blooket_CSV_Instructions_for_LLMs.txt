Blooket CSV Format Specification for LLMs (v2.0 – Guaranteed Import-Safe)
How to Generate Perfect Blooket Import Files for Teachers

OVERVIEW

Blooket accepts quiz questions via CSV upload.
This document provides strict rules for LLMs to produce Blooket files that will import without errors or silent row deletion.
All text output must be ASCII-safe.

CSV FILE STRUCTURE

REQUIRED Format:

File Type: CSV

Encoding: UTF-8

File extension: .csv

REQUIRED First Row (must match exactly):
Question #,Question Text,Answer 1,Answer 2,Answer 3,Answer 4,Time Limit (sec),Correct Answer(s)

Notes:

Column names must match exactly (case, spacing, punctuation).

Exactly 8 columns, never more, never fewer.

Do not add, remove, rename, or reorder columns.

ASCII-ONLY RULES (CRITICAL)

Blooket fails or drops rows if non-ASCII characters are used.

LLMs must output ASCII-only text.

Replace all:

Curly quotes (“ ”) -> "

Curly apostrophes (’) -> '

Em dashes (—) -> -

En dashes (–) -> -

Ellipses (…) -> ...

Accented characters -> unaccented equivalents (example: Seguin not Seguín)

Bullet points -> hyphens or plain lines

Any other Unicode punctuation -> plain ASCII

Forbidden:

Emojis

HTML

Markdown

Non-ASCII characters of any kind

Line breaks inside a cell

COLUMN-BY-COLUMN SPECIFICATION

Column 1: Question #

Integer

Sequential starting at 1

No text

Column 2: Question Text

ASCII-only

No commas unless the entire field is wrapped in double quotes

No quotes unless escaped correctly

Prefer short single-sentence questions with no trailing period

Recommended max length 200 characters

Preferred examples:
What is the main idea
How do robots help workers
What does the poem show

Columns 3–6: Answers

ASCII-only

No commas unless entire field is quoted

1 to 10 words recommended

Answers must be similar in length

Must include at least Answer 1 and Answer 2

Answer 3 and 4 may be left blank (but columns must exist)

Do not use HTML, symbols, or special punctuation

Column 7: Time Limit (sec)

Integer between 5 and 300

Recommended: 20

Column 8: Correct Answer(s)

Use 1-based indexing (1, 2, 3, or 4)

For multiple correct answers, wrap in quotes, example: "1,3"

Never use 0-based indexing

CSV FORMATTING RULES

Commas

If ANY comma appears in a field, wrap the entire field in double quotes.

Quotes

If a field contains quotes, escape by doubling them.

Example:
"Print(""Hello"") outputs Hello"

No line breaks inside fields

One question per line only

Avoid long questions

Long questions increase the chance of punctuation errors or accidental Unicode characters.

PEDAGOGICAL GUIDELINES

Distractors must be:

Plausible

Relevant

Same topic family as the correct answer

Similar in length

Difficulty mix:

60 percent easy

30 percent medium

10 percent hard

Avoid giving away correct answers:

Keep all answer lengths within 20 percent of each other.
