Gimkit CSV Format Specification for LLMs (Plain Text Version)
How to Generate Perfect Gimkit Import Files

OVERVIEW

Gimkit is a game-based learning platform that accepts quiz imports via CSV files.
This document provides exact formatting requirements and best practices for LLMs generating Gimkit-compatible content.
All text output must be ASCII-safe.

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS

File Structure

Format: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

Encoding: UTF-8

Line Endings: Standard (LF or CRLF both work)

File Extension: .csv

Required First Line (Row 1)
Gimkit’s official template includes a title line before the headers. LLM output must start with this exact line (five columns total, four trailing commas):
Gimkit Spreadsheet Import Template,,,,

Column Headers (Row 2 - REQUIRED)
These must match exactly, including capitalization, spacing, and the text "(Optional)". Data rows begin on Row 3:
Question,Correct Answer,Incorrect Answer 1,Incorrect Answer 2 (Optional),Incorrect Answer 3 (Optional)

CRITICAL:

Row 1 title and row 2 headers must match exactly as shown (case-sensitive).

Include all 5 columns even if optional answers are not used in data rows.

Do not add extra columns.

Do not modify column names.

Do not make the correct answer much shorter or much longer than the incorrect answers.

Note: "(Optional)" is part of the header text for columns 4 and 5.

ASCII-ONLY RULES (CRITICAL)

Gimkit CSV imports may fail or behave unexpectedly when non-ASCII characters are used.

LLMs must output ASCII-only text.

Replace all:

Curly quotes (“ ”) with straight quotes "

Curly apostrophes (’) with straight apostrophe '

Em dashes (—) with hyphen -

En dashes (–) with hyphen -

Ellipses (…) with three periods ...

Accented characters with unaccented equivalents

Bullet points with hyphens or plain lines

Forbidden:

Emojis

Non-ASCII punctuation

HTML tags

Markdown formatting

Line breaks inside any cell

COLUMN SPECIFICATIONS

Column 1: Question

Type: String

Max Length: about 500 characters recommended

Formatting: Plain text only (no HTML, no Markdown)

Special Characters: Punctuation is welcome for clarity; for CSV safety, if ANY punctuation appears (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in double quotes (escape quotes by doubling). Underscores and hyphens are safe even unquoted, but quoting them is fine for consistency. Spaces inside a field are fine when quoted (e.g., "The dog barked at the cat, which made the cat jump."). Do not add spaces before/after the commas that divide fields.

Required: Yes

Critical rules for questions:

Punctuation is OK; wrap the entire question field in double quotes whenever any punctuation is present (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.).

Every question must be self-contained. Do not refer to a passage or code that is "above" or "before" the question.

Good examples:
What is 2 plus 2
Which Python command imports the debugger
What type of error prevents code from running

Bad examples:
What is "2 + 2" (unescaped quotes)
Based on the passage above what is the answer (refers to non-existent passage)
What is the correct answer (vague and unhelpful)

Column 2: Correct Answer

Type: String

Max Length: about 200 characters recommended

Formatting: Plain text only

Required: Yes

Must be exactly one correct answer.

Guidelines:

Keep answers concise (1 to 15 words is ideal).

Punctuation is OK; if ANY punctuation appears (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in double quotes (escape quotes by doubling). Underscores and hyphens are safe even unquoted, but quoting them is fine for consistency. Spaces inside a field are fine when quoted; do not add spaces before/after the commas that divide fields.

Column 3: Incorrect Answer 1

Type: String

Required: Yes

Must be a plausible but incorrect distractor.

Columns 4 and 5: Incorrect Answer 2 (Optional), Incorrect Answer 3 (Optional)

Type: String

Required: No (but recommended for better gameplay).

Can be left blank (empty) if not used.

Best practice: Provide at least 3 total answers (1 correct and 2 incorrect) when possible.

CSV FORMATTING RULES

Punctuation Handling (CRITICAL)
Gimkit CSV formatting is sensitive to punctuation; quoting makes it safe.

Rule 1: If ANY punctuation appears in a field (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in double quotes; escape quotes by doubling. This is to protect CSV parsing, not to discourage punctuation.
Example: "The dog barked at the cat, which made the cat jump."
Example: "What is the output of print(1, 2, 3)",1 2 3,123,1-2-3,Error

Rule 2: Underscores (and hyphens) are allowed/encouraged for code-like tokens; they do not require quotes, but quoting them is acceptable.

Rule 3: Do not add spaces before or after the commas that divide fields; spaces inside fields are fine when quoted. Trim accidental leading/trailing spaces unless intentional.

Quote Handling

Avoid quotes within text when possible. If quotes are necessary, escape them by doubling the quote character (even when the field is already quoted for punctuation).

Example:
"What does print(""Hello"") output",Hello,"""Hello""",Error,Nothing

Empty Optional Fields

Leave optional fields completely blank (no text between commas).

Example:
Is Python case sensitive,Yes,No,,

Do not write "N/A" or "None". Just leave the field empty.

Self-Contained Questions (CRITICAL)
Every question must be complete without external context.

Wrong:
Based on paragraph 3 what is the main idea
According to the passage above who discovered penicillin
In the previous example what happens when you divide by zero

Correct:
What is the main idea of photosynthesis
Who discovered penicillin
What happens when you divide by zero in Python

No Line Breaks

Keep all text for one question on a single row.

Do not insert multi-line text within any cell.

ANSWER WRITING BEST PRACTICES

Strategic Distractors
Wrong answers should be plausible but clearly incorrect.

Good distractor strategies:

Use related terminology from the same topic.

Use common student misconceptions.

Mix up similar concepts.

Use near-correct numbers or terms.

Example:
Question: What command imports the Python debugger

Good distractors:
import debug
import debugger
pdb.import

Poor distractors:
banana
12345
print

Answer Length Balance

Keep all answers roughly the same length.

Do not make the correct answer obviously longer or shorter.

Aim for 1 to 10 words per answer.

Difficulty Balance

Easy (about 60 percent): Clear right answer, obviously wrong distractors.

Medium (about 30 percent): Related distractors that require understanding.

Hard (about 10 percent): Close distractors that test fine distinctions.

Or:
"What is the sum of 2, 3, and 4",9,8,10,11

Wrong: Non self contained question
Based on the code above what is the output,15,12,18,20

Correct: Self contained with context
What is the output of 5 plus 10,15,12,18,20

Wrong: Random nonsense distractors
What is a syntax error,Error in code structure,Banana,Purple,Twelve

Correct: Plausible related distractors

OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS FOR LLMS

When asked to create a Gimkit review or quiz:

Determine question count (if not specified, 20 to 40 is a good range).

Identify key concepts to cover.

Write self contained questions with clear wording.

Punctuation is fine; whenever a field contains punctuation, wrap the entire field in double quotes and double any quotes inside. Do not add spaces around delimiter commas (spaces inside a field are fine when quoted).

Provide:

1 correct answer (required)

At least 1 incorrect answer (required)

Up to 3 incorrect answers total (optional but recommended)

Format as CSV with the template title line followed by the exact header row specified.

Keep all text ASCII and on a single line per question.

Quote any field that contains punctuation; double any quotes inside fields; do not add spaces around delimiter commas (spaces inside a field are fine when quoted).

Save as .csv.

KEY DIFFERENCES FROM BLOOKET

Gimkit does not require a question number column.

Gimkit does not take time limits in the CSV.

Correct answers are specified as text, not by index.

Multiple correct answers per question are not supported in the CSV.

Headers include the text "(Optional)" in two columns.

Questions must be fully self contained.

Punctuation handling: Quote any field with punctuation; underscores/hyphens are safe unquoted, but quoting them is fine (aligns with Blooket CSV safety guidance).

FINAL NOTES

Gimkit automatically shuffles answer order during gameplay.

20 to 40 questions is usually ideal for a single game session.

Test imports with a small sample file before committing to a large set.

Group questions by topic or difficulty when possible for better pedagogy.
