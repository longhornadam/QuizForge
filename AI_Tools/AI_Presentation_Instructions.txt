AI Presentation Helper - Conversational Guide
---------------------------------------------
Purpose: help teachers ask an LLM for a short, impactful slide deck. Keep it flexible, plain text, and classroom-ready. Always prioritize explicit teacher input over any default guidance here.

Output preference: PPTX first. If PPTX isn't possible, produce clean HTML the teacher can download as a file.

How to ask (fill the blanks)
----------------------------
You are helping a teacher build a short slide deck.
Topic: {topic}
Objective: {one-sentence learning goal}
Audience: {grade/age}, reading level: {level}
Context: {time available}, devices: {none/phones/laptops}, class size: {n}
Slides: {6-10}, text-only unless asked otherwise
Tone: {warm, concise, non-jargony}
Include on each slide: title + 2-4 bullet talking points + 1 facilitation note
Checks: at least 2 checks for understanding + 1 exit ticket
Accessibility: avoid niche metaphors; keep examples culturally neutral; plain language
Provide: one alternate hook option; one localized example the teacher can swap in
Output: PPTX file (downloadable). If not feasible, provide HTML packaged so it can be saved as a .html file and opened locally.

Example prompt (PPTX first, HTML fallback)
------------------------------------------
You are helping me create a short slide deck.
Topic: Inference from short fiction
Objective: Students will infer character motivation using text evidence.
Audience: Grade 8, reading level: Grade 7
Context: 20 minutes, devices: Chromebooks, class size: 28
Slides: 8, text-only on slides; add speaker notes
Tone: Warm, concise, non-jargony
Include on each slide: title + 2-4 bullet talking points + 1 facilitation note
Checks: 2 checks for understanding + 1 exit ticket with expected answers
Accessibility: avoid niche metaphors; keep examples culturally neutral; plain language
Provide: one alternate hook; one localized example swap
Output: a downloadable PPTX. If PPTX is not possible, provide a single self-contained HTML file I can save as .html and open locally.

Expected LLM response format
----------------------------
Slide 1 (Hook): Title
- Bullet 1
- Bullet 2
- Facilitation: ...
Slide 2 (Model/Explain): ...
...
Checks for Understanding: Q1, Q2 (with expected answers)
Exit Ticket: prompt + what "good" looks like
Alternatives: Hook B; Localized example swap
Output note: supply a downloadable PPTX. If not possible, supply HTML that renders the slides and can be saved as a single file.

What "good" looks like
----------------------
- Aligned: everything points to the stated objective.
- Light: short phrases, no walls of text; slides are cues, not scripts.
- Applicable: includes quick prompts (think-pair-share, thumbs-up/down, 2-sentence written response).
- Checkable: at least two CFUs and an exit ticket with expected responses or rubrics.
- Adaptable: gives a second hook and a localizable example so teachers can swap context fast.
- Inclusive: avoids narrow metaphors, slang, or culturally specific knowledge unless requested.

Do / Don't
----------
- Do: cite paragraph numbers or source snippets if referring to a text.
- Do: offer brief speaker/facilitation notes for pacing and misconceptions to watch.
- Do: keep language plain; aim one grade level below the audience for readability.
- Do: follow teacher-provided constraints even if they conflict with defaults here.
- Don't: output HTML, CSS, or JS unless the teacher explicitly asks for slide-ready markup or PPTX is not feasible.
- Don't: lock into a single theme (e.g., sports); keep examples generic unless a theme is provided.

Optional follow-ups a teacher might request
-------------------------------------------
- Differentiate for struggling readers (simplify language, add visuals described in text).
- Stretch tasks for fast finishers.
- Swap modality (no devices vs. laptops).
- Add timing estimates per slide.
