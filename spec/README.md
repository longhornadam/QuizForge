# Spec (JSON 3.0 / QF_Base)

- Inputs: `spec/inputs/`
- Outputs: `spec/outputs/`
- Docs: `spec/docs/` (NEWBASE.md, examples)
- Runner: `python spec/run_firsttest.py` (uses `spec/inputs/attempt9_docx_all_types_13q.txt` by default)

The newspec/test assets were moved here from `dev/newspec` and JSON mode is now the default path through the engine.
