QuizForge Starter Template (QF_Base)
Version: 3.0-json

How to use this:
1) Copy this template into your LLM chat, fill in your questions and answers, and keep the JSON between the <QUIZFORGE_JSON> tags.
2) Paste the finished text back into QuizForge (recommended) or save it as a .txt/.json/.md file and upload.
3) QuizForge will validate, package, and return a ZIP you can import into Canvas or print.

Example skeleton (replace with your own content):
<QUIZFORGE_JSON>
{
  "version": "3.0-json",
  "title": "Photosynthesis Check-in",
  "items": [
    {
      "type": "mc",
      "prompt": "Which organelle is responsible for photosynthesis?",
      "options": [
        {"label": "A", "text": "Mitochondria"},
        {"label": "B", "text": "Chloroplast"},
        {"label": "C", "text": "Ribosome"},
        {"label": "D", "text": "Golgi apparatus"}
      ],
      "answer": "B",
      "rationale": "Chloroplasts contain chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis."
    }
  ],
  "rationales": [
    {
      "item_ref": 0,
      "text": "Chloroplasts hold chlorophyll, which captures light energy for photosynthesis."
    }
  ]
}
</QUIZFORGE_JSON>

Tips for better results:
- Keep quotes double, avoid trailing commas, and stay inside the JSON tags.
- Provide clear question prompts and concise answer choices.
- Include rationales so QuizForge can build teacher keys.
