# Gimkit CSV Format Specification for LLMs
**How to Generate Perfect Gimkit Import Files**

---

## Overview
Gimkit is a game-based learning platform that accepts quiz imports via CSV files. This document provides exact formatting requirements and best practices for LLMs generating Gimkit-compatible content.

---

## Critical Format Requirements

### File Structure
- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Line Endings**: Standard (LF or CRLF both work)
- **File Extension**: .csv

### Column Headers (Row 1 - REQUIRED)
```
Question,Correct Answer,Incorrect Answer 1,Incorrect Answer 2 (Optional),Incorrect Answer 3 (Optional)
```

**CRITICAL**: 
- Headers must match EXACTLY as shown above (case-sensitive)
- Include all 5 columns even if optional answers are not used
- Do NOT add extra columns
- Do NOT modify column names
- Do NOT make the correct answer 30% shorter or longer than the average of all choices
- Note: "(Optional)" is part of the header text for columns 4 and 5

---

## Column Specifications

### Column 1: Question
- **Type**: String
- **Max Length**: ~500 characters recommended
- **Formatting**: Plain text only (no HTML, no Markdown)
- **Special Characters**: Minimize use; avoid unescaped quotes
- **Required**: Yes

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Avoid superfluous punctuation (can break CSV formatting)
- Only include commas when absolutely necessary
- When commas ARE necessary, enclose entire question in quotes
- All questions must be self-contained (no references to external passages)

**Good Examples:**
```
What is 2 + 2?
Which Python command imports the debugger?
What type of error prevents code from running?
```

**Bad Examples:**
```
What is "2 + 2"?  [WRONG] (unescaped quotes)
Based on the passage above, what is the answer?  [WRONG] (refers to non-existent passage)
What's the **correct** answer?  [WRONG] (markdown formatting)
```

### Column 2: Correct Answer
- **Type**: String
- **Max Length**: ~200 characters recommended
- **Formatting**: Plain text only
- **Required**: Yes
- **Must be**: Exactly one correct answer

**Important:**
- Keep answers concise (1-15 words ideal)
- Avoid unnecessary punctuation
- If answer contains comma, wrap in quotes

### Column 3: Incorrect Answer 1
- **Type**: String
- **Required**: Yes
- **Must be**: A plausible but incorrect distractor

### Columns 4-5: Incorrect Answer 2 (Optional), Incorrect Answer 3 (Optional)
- **Type**: String
- **Required**: No (but recommended for better gameplay)
- **Can be left blank**: Yes
- **Best practice**: Provide at least 3 total answers (1 correct + 2 incorrect) minimum

## CSV Formatting Rules

### 1. Comma Handling (CRITICAL)
Gimkit CSV formatting is sensitive to commas. Follow these rules:

**Rule 1: Avoid commas in questions/answers when possible**
```
Good: What is the output of print(1 2 3)?
Bad: What is the output of print(1, 2, 3)?
```

**Rule 2: If comma is absolutely necessary, wrap entire field in quotes**
```
"What is the output of print(1, 2, 3)?",1 2 3,123,1-2-3,Error
```

**Rule 3: Never use commas unnecessarily in answers**
```
Good: Syntax error
Bad: Syntax error, which prevents code from running
```

### 2. Quote Handling
- Avoid quotes within text when possible
- If quotes are necessary, escape by doubling:
```
"What does print(""Hello"") output?",Hello,"""Hello""",Error,Nothing
```

### 3. Empty Optional Fields
- Leave blank (no text between commas):
```
Is Python case-sensitive?,Yes,No,,
```
- Do NOT write "N/A" or "None" - just leave empty

### 4. Self-Contained Questions
**CRITICAL**: Every question must be complete without external context

[WRONG] WRONG:
```
Based on paragraph 3, what is the main idea?
According to the passage above, who discovered...?
In the previous example, what happens when...?
```

[CORRECT] CORRECT:
```
What is the main idea of photosynthesis?
Who discovered penicillin?
What happens when you divide by zero in Python?
```

### 5. No Line Breaks
- Keep all text for one question on a single row
- Avoid multi-line text within cells

---

## Answer Writing Best Practices

### Strategic Distractors
Create wrong answers that are **plausible but clearly incorrect**:

**Good Distractor Strategies:**
- Related terminology from same topic
- Common student misconceptions
- Mix up similar concepts
- Near-correct values

**Example:**
```
Question: What command imports the Python debugger?
[CORRECT] Good Distractors:
- import debug (similar syntax)
- import debugger (close term)
- pdb.import() (related but backwards)

[WRONG] Poor Distractors:
- banana (random)
- 12345 (nonsensical)
- print() (unrelated)
```

### Answer Length Balance
- Keep all answers roughly the same length
- Don't make correct answer obviously longer/shorter
- Aim for 1-10 words per answer

### Difficulty Balance
- **Easy (60%)**: Clear right answer, obviously wrong distractors
- **Medium (30%)**: Related distractors requiring understanding
- **Hard (10%)**: Close distractors testing fine distinctions

## Complete Example

```csv
Question,Correct Answer,Incorrect Answer 1,Incorrect Answer 2 (Optional),Incorrect Answer 3 (Optional)
What type of error prevents code from running?,Syntax error,Logic error,Runtime error,Exception
What does pdb stand for?,Python Debugger,Python Debug Base,Program Database,Python Developer Board
Which debugger command steps to next line?,s,c,p,q
What happens when you divide by zero?,Runtime exception,Returns zero,Returns None,Syntax error
True or False: Python is case-sensitive,True,False,,
```

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### [WRONG] WRONG: Missing required headers
```csv
Question,Answer,Wrong1,Wrong2
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: Exact header match
```csv
Question,Correct Answer,Incorrect Answer 1,Incorrect Answer 2 (Optional),Incorrect Answer 3 (Optional)
```

---

### [WRONG] WRONG: Only 1 answer total
```csv
What is Python?,A programming language,,,
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: At least 2 answers (1 correct + 1 incorrect minimum)
```csv
What is Python?,A programming language,A snake species,,
```

---

### [WRONG] WRONG: Unnecessary commas in text
```csv
What is the sum of 2, 3, and 4?,9,8,10,11
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: Avoid commas or quote if necessary
```csv
What is the sum of 2 plus 3 plus 4?,9,8,10,11
```
OR
```csv
"What is the sum of 2, 3, and 4?",9,8,10,11
```

---

### [WRONG] WRONG: Non-self-contained question
```csv
Based on the code above what is the output?,15,12,18,20
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: Self-contained with context
```csv
What is the output of 5 + 10?,15,12,18,20
```

---

### [WRONG] WRONG: Random nonsense distractors
```csv
What is a syntax error?,Error in code structure,Banana,Purple,Twelve
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: Plausible related distractors
```csv
What is a syntax error?,Error in code structure,Error in logic,Runtime crash,Missing variable
```

## Advanced Tips

### For Code-Based Questions
**Avoid commas in code examples:**
```
Good: What does print(x y z) output?
Better: What is the output when printing three variables?
```

**If code must be shown:**
```
"In Python, what does x = [1, 2, 3] create?",A list,A tuple,A dictionary,A set
```

### For Math Questions
**Avoid comma-heavy number formatting:**
```
Good: What is one thousand plus one thousand?
Good: What is 1000 plus 1000?
Bad: What is 1,000 + 1,000?
```

### For True/False Questions
**Use exactly 2 answers:**
```
Is Python case-sensitive?,Yes,No,,
True or False: Comments help explain code,True,False,,
```

## Troubleshooting Import Failures

If Gimkit rejects your CSV:

1. **Check headers**: Must match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. **Check for unquoted commas**: Quote any field containing commas
3. **Check for line breaks**: All text must be on single row
4. **Check for external references**: Questions must be self-contained
5. **Check answer count**: Must have at least 1 correct + 1 incorrect
6. **Check encoding**: Save as UTF-8
7. **Test with simple example**: Start with 5 questions to verify format

---

## Final Notes

- Gimkit automatically shuffles answer order during gameplay
- Students can play multiple times, so question variety helps
- 20-40 questions is ideal range for single game session
- More than 50 questions may be overwhelming
- Consider grouping by difficulty if creating large sets
- Test import with small sample before creating full set
