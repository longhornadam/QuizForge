# Blooket CSV Format Specification for LLMs
**How to Generate Perfect Blooket Import Files**

---

## Overview
Blooket is a game-based learning platform that accepts quiz imports via CSV files. This document provides exact formatting requirements and best practices for LLMs generating Blooket-compatible content.

---

## Critical Format Requirements

### File Structure
- **Format**: CSV (Comma-Separated Values)
- **Encoding**: UTF-8
- **Line Endings**: Standard (LF or CRLF both work)
- **File Extension**: .csv

### Column Headers (Row 1 - REQUIRED)
```
Question #,Question Text,Answer 1,Answer 2,Answer 3,Answer 4,Time Limit (sec),Correct Answer(s)
```

**CRITICAL**: 
- Headers must match EXACTLY as shown above (case-sensitive)
- Include all 8 columns even if Answer 3/Answer 4 are optional for some questions
- Do NOT add extra columns
- Do NOT modify column names
- Do NOT make the correct answer 30% shorter or longer than the average of all choices

---

## Column Specifications

### Column 1: Question #
- **Type**: Integer
- **Format**: Sequential numbering starting from 1
- **Example**: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
- **Required**: Yes

### Column 2: Question Text
- **Type**: String
- **Max Length**: ~500 characters recommended
- **Formatting**: Plain text (no HTML, no Markdown)
- **Special Characters**: If ANY punctuation appears (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in double quotes; escape quotes by doubling. Punctuation is welcome for clarity; quoting is for CSV safety, not to discourage use. Underscores (and hyphens) are safe even unquoted, but quoting them is fine for consistency.
- **Required**: Yes

**Good Examples:**
```
What is 2 + 2?
Which Python command imports the debugger?
What type of error prevents code from running?
```

**Bad Examples:**
```
What is "2 + 2"?  [WRONG] (unescaped quotes)
What's the **answer**?  [WRONG] (markdown formatting)
<p>What is this?</p>  [WRONG] (HTML tags)
```

### Columns 3-6: Answer 1, Answer 2, Answer 3, Answer 4
- **Type**: String
- **Required**: Answer 1 and Answer 2 are REQUIRED; Answer 3 and Answer 4 are OPTIONAL
- **Max Length**: ~200 characters recommended per answer
- **Formatting**: Plain text only
- **Special Characters**: If ANY punctuation appears (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in double quotes; escape quotes by doubling. Punctuation is welcome for clarity; quoting is for CSV safety, not to discourage use. Underscores (and hyphens) are safe even unquoted, but quoting them is fine for consistency.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- At least 2 answers required (Answer 1 and Answer 2)
- Exactly ONE answer must be marked correct in Column 8
- If using only 2 answers, leave Answer 3 and Answer 4 empty (blank, not "N/A" or "None")

**Example with 4 answers:**
```
3,What is the capital of France?,Paris,London,Berlin,Rome,20,1
```

**Example with 2 answers:**
```
5,Is Python case-sensitive?,Yes,No,,,15,1
```
(Note: Answer 3 and Answer 4 are empty)

### Column 7: Time Limit (sec)
- **Type**: Integer
- **Range**: 5-300 seconds
- **Default**: 20 seconds recommended
- **Required**: Yes

**Recommended Time Limits by Difficulty:**
- Simple recall: 15-20 seconds
- Code analysis: 30-45 seconds
- Complex reasoning: 45-60 seconds

### Column 8: Correct Answer(s)
- **Type**: Integer or comma-separated integers
- **Format**: The number(s) corresponding to correct answer column(s)
  - `1` = Answer 1 is correct
  - `2` = Answer 2 is correct
  - `3` = Answer 3 is correct
  - `4` = Answer 4 is correct
  - `1,3` = Both Answer 1 AND Answer 3 are correct (multiple correct answers)
- **Required**: Yes
- **Must match**: One of the answer columns that contains content

**Examples:**
```
1,What is 2+2?,4,3,5,6,20,1
```
(Answer 1 "4" is correct)

```
2,Select prime numbers,2,4,3,6,30,"1,3"
```
(Answer 1 "2" and Answer 3 "3" are both correct - note quotes around "1,3")

---

## CSV Formatting Rules

### 1. Punctuation Handling
- Commas separate columns
- If ANY punctuation appears in a field (comma, question mark, colon, semicolon, quote, dash, period, parentheses, etc.), wrap the entire field in quotes:
- Underscores (and hyphens) are allowed/encouraged for code-like tokens; they do not require quotes, but quoting is acceptable.
- Do not add spaces before or after the commas that divide fields. Spaces inside a field are fine when the field is quoted (e.g., "The dog barked at the cat, which made the cat jump."). Avoid accidental leading/trailing spaces unless intentional.
```
3,"What is the output of print(1, 2, 3)?",1 2 3,123,1-2-3,Error,20,1
```

### 2. Quote Handling
- If text contains quotes, escape them by doubling (even when the field is already quoted for punctuation):
```
4,"What does print(""Hello"") output?",Hello,"""Hello""",Error,Nothing,20,1
```

### 3. Empty Fields
- Leave optional fields blank (no text between commas):
```
5,True or False: Python is case-sensitive,True,False,,,15,1
```

### 4. No Line Breaks in Fields
- Keep all text for one question on a single row
- Avoid multi-line text within a cell

## Answer Writing Best Practices

### Create Strategic Distractors
Wrong answers should be **plausible but incorrect**. Good distractors:
- Use related terminology from the same topic
- Include common student misconceptions
- Mix up similar concepts
- Use near-correct values or terms

**Example:**
```
Question: What command imports the Python debugger?
[CORRECT] Good Distractors:
- import debug (similar syntax)
- import debugger (close term)
- from pdb import trace (related but wrong)

[WRONG] Poor Distractors:
- banana (completely random)
- 12345 (nonsensical)
- install pdb (unrelated concept)
```

### Balance Difficulty
- **Easy questions (60%)**: Clear right answer, obviously wrong distractors
- **Medium questions (30%)**: Require understanding, distractors are related concepts
- **Hard questions (10%)**: Close distractors that test fine distinctions

### Answer Length
- Keep answers roughly similar in length
- Don't make the correct answer obviously longer/shorter
- Aim for 1-10 words per answer

## Prevent Predictable Correct-Answer Patterns
- Track how many times each answer slot (1-4) is marked correct while authoring.
- Keep counts within 1 of each other and rotate so no slot is correct more than twice in a row.
- Use every slot at least once by question 8 (or rotate 1 and 2 if only two answers are used).
- For multiple-correct questions, count the lowest-numbered correct slot toward distribution.
- After the CSV block, add a short audit line (outside the CSV file) showing counts and max streak, e.g.:
`Answer slot usage (correct answers): A1=5, A2=5, A3=5, A4=5; Max streak=2`

## Complete Example

```csv
Question #,Question Text,Answer 1,Answer 2,Answer 3,Answer 4,Time Limit (sec),Correct Answer(s)
1,What type of error prevents code from running?,Logic error,Syntax error,Runtime error,Exception,20,2
2,What does pdb stand for?,Python Debugger,Python Debug Base,Program Database,Python Developer Board,20,1
3,Which debugger command steps to next line?,s,c,n,step,15,1
4,"In Python, what happens when you divide by zero?",Returns 0,Returns None,Causes exception,Rounds down,25,3
5,True or False: Comments help explain code logic,True,False,,,15,1
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### [WRONG] WRONG: Missing required headers
```csv
Question,Answer1,Answer2,Correct
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: All headers present
```csv
Question #,Question Text,Answer 1,Answer 2,Answer 3,Answer 4,Time Limit (sec),Correct Answer(s)
```

---

### [WRONG] WRONG: Using 0-based indexing for correct answers
```csv
1,What is 2+2?,4,3,5,6,20,0
```
(Correct answer column uses 1, 2, 3, 4 - not 0, 1, 2, 3)

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: 1-based indexing
```csv
1,What is 2+2?,4,3,5,6,20,1
```

---

### [WRONG] WRONG: Only 1 answer provided
```csv
1,What is Python?,A programming language,,,,20,1
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: At least 2 answers
```csv
1,What is Python?,A programming language,A snake species,,,20,1
```

---

### [WRONG] WRONG: Unescaped commas in text
```csv
1,What is the output of print(1, 2, 3)?,1 2 3,123,Error,Nothing,20,1
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: Quoted text with commas
```csv
1,"What is the output of print(1, 2, 3)?",1 2 3,123,Error,Nothing,20,1
```

---

### [WRONG] WRONG: Multiple correct answers without quotes
```csv
5,Select all prime numbers,2,3,4,6,30,1,2
```

### [CORRECT] CORRECT: Multiple correct answers in quotes
```csv
5,Select all prime numbers,2,3,4,6,30,"1,2"
```

- [ ] Correct-answer slots balanced: no slot correct 3+ times in a row; counts stay within 1; all slots used early
- [ ] No line breaks within questions
- [ ] Distractors are plausible, not random
- [ ] No HTML/Markdown formatting in text
- [ ] Multiple correct answers are in quotes: "1,3" not 1,3
- [ ] Usage audit line printed after the CSV (not part of the CSV file)

## Output Instructions for LLMs

When asked to create a Blooket review/quiz:

1. **Determine question count**: Ask if not specified (recommend 20-30)
2. **Identify key concepts**: Cover main topics comprehensively
3. **Write questions**: Mix difficulty levels (60% easy, 30% medium, 10% hard)
4. **Create 4 answers per question** when possible:
   - 1 correct answer
   - 3 strategic distractors (plausible but wrong)
5. **Set appropriate time limits**: 15-30 seconds for most questions
6. **Format as CSV**: Follow exact column structure above
7. **Quote any field containing punctuation**; double quotes inside fields
8. **Track answer-slot usage**: Keep counts even, avoid streaks >2, use all slots
9. **Output the file**: Save as .csv extension
10. **Add a distribution audit line** after the CSV (outside the file contents)
