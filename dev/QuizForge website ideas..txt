QuizForge website ideas.

Clean, modern, but focused on productivity and not pretty gadgets and big spacious squircles.

-----------

- Upload TXT to QuizForge (will output a .ZIP containing all the cool stuff)
- Provide direct download links for each `QF_MOD_*` bundle plus a “grab them all” button so teachers can drop the markdown files into their LLM projects without hunting through GitHub.
- Let users paste quiz specs instead of only uploading TXT (drop raw text into a big textarea, preview parser feedback, then run the same pipeline).
- Host the engine in the background: queue the TXT, run the existing orchestration, and return a single ZIP labeled “UNZIP THIS FIRST” that contains Canvas export, printable quiz/key, rationales, logs, and any warnings.
- Immediately show processing status (Queued → Parsing → Validating → Packaging) with inline guidance if FAIL occurs, plus a “copy fail log” button to paste back into the LLM.
- Include a “Resources” panel linking to BASE, RIGOR, Differentiation, etc., each with a 1-line blurb and download button so teachers know these modules exist.
- Document the offline workflow right on the site for tech‑shy teachers: Step 1 load modules into LLM, Step 2 chat and export TXT, Step 3 upload/paste TXT here, Step 4 unzip results.
- Expose CLI instructions for power users (how to run the Python orchestrator locally) alongside the web UI so both workflows stay in sync.


Overview Concepts:
What kind of metaphor? Like we're building our LLM teaching assistant's brain by loading in the modules? It delivers the TXT, QF takes the TXT and turns it into products?

Download Concepts:
QF_Base - "REQUIRED"
QF_Base + Rigor + Differentiation - "RECOMMENDED"
Dropdown? Selectable? for extras  ("Packs" for teacher types - We ask what grade level/subject and just deliver them RECOMMENDED + DISCIPLINES)

Input Concepts:
"Upload TXT" button + slim "Paste Here" that will auto-expand upon click
(Advanced Users - download QuizForge for yourself and run it locally) (Git link?)

Processing Feedback while working:
Reassures users SOMETHING is happening. Fail text for them to copy/paste into their LLM.
