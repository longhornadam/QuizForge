In the song "If You Kill Me" by Hovey Benjamin, the singer creates a cringey and humorous tone. He does this by mimicking today's style of rappers by repeating words in the song. For example, when it repeats "Leprechaun(X7)" and "Lucky Charms(X7)". Similar to the tone, the mood is also humorous but some parts are serious. The author shows this by talking about karma and how people want him dead;but, the author makes it humorous by using unrealistic topics like coming back to life as a zombie or a werewolf. For example, when it says "What goes around comes back around I got enemies who want me in the ground" which shows that Hovey made this song to sounds like today's style of rap that makes the listener laugh.

In "If you Kill Me" The authors tone contrast the lyrics by bein serious while what he is saying is comical. This is proven in the song when he is rapping this verse. I'll be a werewolf (swoop) Or a wizard (swoop) Or a Jason Or a leprechaun Leprechaun (x7) Lucky Charm (x7) ." He rapped these lyrics with a very serious tone of voice. This contrast to the lyrics because there are supposed to be funny. This adds to the song by giving it a unique feel. In conclusion, the tone of the author's voice is in contrast to the which makes him sound very unique to his own song.

The authors tone contrasts the lyrics of the song and creates a sense of darkness but on the other hand, the lyrics are ridiculous. The tone is dark and heavy whereas the lyrics are ridiculous and comical. In the poem in stanza 5 it says "But you won't be talking so tough when I fly up to you on a broomstick " These lyrics show contrast to the dark and moody beat of the song and tone as well. In the poem it shows the difference between the goofy and funny lyrics and the heavy beat of the song in stanza 1 when it says "I got enemies who want me in the ground/If you ever catch me better watch your back /'Cuz if you kill me imma kill you back" This evidence shows the more deep and serious part of the song. The lyrics and the tone contrast a lot and create a tone or sense of humour in the listener. The tone and the beat of the song are very deep, heavy, and serious versus the lyrics are funny, hilarious, and jocular.

The song, “If You Kill Me” by Hovey Benjamin has a very serious, grave tone, but the lyrics are very amusing, causing the reader to feel concerned, then amusement at the irony of having a serious tone with unserious lyrics. Throughout the song, Hovey Benjamin keeps up a flat, low, serious tone, much like how you would hear in most rap or rock songs. This creates a feeling of seriousness in the listener; however, this seriousness does not last for long since the lyrics contrast with the tone of Hovey Benjamin’s singing tone. Throughout the song, Hovey Benjamin keeps up the storyline of coming back for revenge, saying how the enemies that killed him are “about to get knocked out by a dead guy with glowing red eyes,” showing that to him it is not a metaphorical death on his part, he is actually going to get them with glowing red eyes; furthermore, he later stated how he could be countless horror creatures, segueing into saying he could be a “Jason, or a Leprechaun, Leprechaun (x7), Lucky charm (x7).” This switch from Leprechaun to Lucky Charm is random and is bound to make the listener question what they are listening to or laugh. This contrast between the seriousness of the song and the unseriousness of the lyrics creates an irony that makes people laugh, giving the song its amusing mood.

Have you ever heard of a singer whom's voice helps with the song's theme? Well that's the case in “If You Kill Me” by Hovey. Hovey’s tone in the song is an almost bored, darker, deeper voice, conveying to the rather dark theme that create a mood of dread to the listener. Most parts of the song display this scary theme of death and revenge, although some parts of the song might be considered more comedy based, Hovey's voice helps listeners grasp the theme. In conclusion, the voice of the singer attends to the theme and lyrics in a way that conveys the dark theme to the listener.

The tone of Hovey’s music is serious and mature, but the lyrics of the song in the other hand, are meant to make the listener laugh and chuckle a little- in other words, not take this song seriously. Though the background track of the ‘rap’ song sounds like any other rap song, the lyrics rather make a bold contrast from the music- making the listener feel iffy with a mix of sneer or ‘cringe’ from it. From Hovey’s music, some lines would list unrealistic things to make the listener laugh, like, “If you ever catch me better watch your back. 'Cuz if you kill me imma kill you back.” Showing ‘revival’ from the dead, other lines would show “You about to get knocked out. By a dead guy, with glowing red eyes.” Or “I'll be a vampire (vampire) or a zombie. (zombie) I can be a mummy, or the bride of Chucky. (Chucky) You say it's unrealistic (huh?), and those things don't exist. But you won't be talking so tough when I fly up to you on a broomstick.” Displaying what the listener would sneer about- due to how ‘cringy’ and unrealistic the lyrics are.

The author's tone and the song's tone contrasts against each other, affecting the listener's mood and what they experience by completely contradicting each other, since the author's tone is so humorous and absurd while the song's tone is deathly serious and menacing. The author's tone is portrayed in lines of him saying things like "I'll be a vampire" and "or a zombie". This is completely different from the song which uses intense pulsing beats, and the author uses silly fictional things. The song's tone is shown from the intense pulsing beats and rhythms. In the beginning of the song, it starts of with quiet, almost sad music, but as it progresses it gets more loud and more aggressive. This is very different from the lyrics the author was rapping, which were more light-hearted, more playful. In conclusion, the author's and song's tone contradict each other, influencing the listener's mood and what they experience, since the lyrics are very entertaining and amusing, while the beat or song is very serious and more violent.
