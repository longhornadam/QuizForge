    "response_text": "<p>In the song \"If You Kill Me\" by Hovey Benjamin, the singer creates a cringey and humorous tone. He does this by mimicking today's style of rappers by repeating words in the song. For example, when it repeats \"Leprechaun(X7)\" and \"Lucky Charms(X7)\".<span class=\"EOP SCXW38186357 BCX0\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"> Similar to the tone, the mood is also humorous but some parts are serious. The author shows this by talking about karma and how people want him dead;but, the author makes it humorous by using unrealistic topics like coming back to life as a zombie or a werewolf. For example, when it says \"</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What goes around comes back around</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">I got enemies who want me in the ground\" which shows that Hovey made this song to sounds like today's style of rap that makes the listener laugh.</span><span><br></span></p>"

This is completely different from the song which uses intense pulsing beats, and the author uses silly fictional things. The song's tone is shown from the intense pulsing beats and rhythms. In the beginning of the song, it starts of with quiet, almost sad music, but as it progresses it gets more loud and more aggressive. This is very different from the lyrics the author was rapping, which were more light-hearted, more playful. In conclusion, the author's and song's tone contradict each other, influencing the listener's mood and what they experience, since the lyrics are very entertaining and amusing, while the beat or song is very serious and more violent.</p>"
