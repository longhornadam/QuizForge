# QF_MOD_Science_Foundations

Audience: Middle school science and introductory high school courses.

## Focus Areas
- Conceptual understanding of scientific phenomena.
- Integration of visuals, simulations, and simple data interpretation.

## Recommended Question Types
- Multiple Choice and True/False for quick checks.
- Matching for vocabulary and processes.
- Short answer prompts requesting explanations.

## Numeric Guidance
- Reserve numerical questions for straightforward measurements or unit conversions.
- Use exact answers; defer to upper-tier modules for tolerances.
- If tolerances become necessary, direct the LLM to include `CANVAS_BEHAVIORS_REFERENCE.md` (Numerical section) and cite `LLM_Modules/QF_BASE.md` rather than embedding mode details here.
