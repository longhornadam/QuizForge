## Avoiding Complexity

### ❌ Don't Use: Advanced Literary Terms

**Skip:** synecdoche, metonymy, epistrophe, zeugma  
**Use instead:** simile, metaphor, rhyme, repetition

### ❌ Don't Ask: Multi-step Analysis

**Bad:**
```
How does the author's use of foreshadowing in paragraph 2 create dramatic 
irony that juxtaposes the protagonist's internal conflict?
```

**Good:**
```
What clue in paragraph 2 hints at what will happen next?
```

### ✅ Do Ask: Clear, Direct Questions

- "What happened first?"
- "How did the character feel?"
- "Where does the story take place?"
- "What is the main idea?"
