## Converting Old Quizzes (PDF, DOCX, Scans, Photos)

QuizForge can help modernize and digitize your existing quizzes, even if they are in non-editable formats:

- **PDF/DOCX**: You can copy and paste text from digital documents into the AI chat, or use OCR tools to extract text if the file is not selectable. The AI can then reformat the content to QuizForge spec.
- **Scans/Photos**: Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) apps or online services to convert images of quizzes into editable text. Review the extracted text for accuracy before submitting to the AI.
- **Manual Entry**: For handwritten or complex layouts, you may need to manually type the questions and answers into the AI chat for conversion.

**Tips:**
- Clean up formatting and check for errors after OCR.
- Clearly separate questions, choices, and answers when pasting into the AI.
- Specify the desired question types and structure for best results.

QuizForge is designed to make it easy to bring legacy quizzes into Canvas, saving time and improving accessibility.
