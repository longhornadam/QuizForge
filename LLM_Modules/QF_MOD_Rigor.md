# QuizForge Pedagogy Module: Bloom's Taxonomy & Rigor
**Higher-Order Thinking | Cognitive Complexity | DOK Levels**

---

## Overview

**Optional module** for teachers wanting explicit cognitive complexity frameworks. Most teachers don't need this - natural question variety often achieves rigor without formal taxonomy.

**Load when:** Teacher requests "rigorous," "higher-order thinking," "Bloom's levels," or "DOK levels."

## Bloom's Taxonomy (Revised)

### Level 1: Remember (Recall)
**Retrieve knowledge from memory**

**Keywords:** define, list, name, identify, recall, state

**Example:**
```
What is the capital of France?
- [x] Paris
```

**Percentage goal:** 5-15% of quiz

---

### Level 2: Understand (Comprehension)
**Explain ideas or concepts**

**Keywords:** explain, describe, summarize, paraphrase, classify

**Example:**
```
Explain in your own words what photosynthesis is.
```

**Percentage goal:** 10-20% of quiz

---

### Level 3: Apply
**Use information in new situations**

**Keywords:** use, solve, demonstrate, calculate, apply

**Example:**
```
Given this code snippet, what will it output?
```

**Percentage goal:** 20-30% of quiz

---

### Level 4: Analyze
**Break down information and examine relationships**

**Keywords:** compare, contrast, examine, differentiate, analyze

**Example:**
```
Compare photosynthesis and cellular respiration. How are they related?
```

**Percentage goal:** 20-25% of quiz

---

### Level 5: Evaluate
**Make judgments based on criteria**

**Keywords:** judge, critique, assess, justify, argue

**Example:**
```
Which sorting algorithm is most efficient for this scenario and why?
```

**Percentage goal:** 15-20% of quiz

---

### Level 6: Create
**Produce new or original work**

**Keywords:** design, construct, create, develop, formulate

**Example:**
```
Design an experiment to test whether temperature affects enzyme activity.
```

**Percentage goal:** 10-15% of quiz

---

## Webb's Depth of Knowledge (DOK)

### DOK Level 1: Recall & Reproduction
- Basic facts and definitions
- Simple procedures

**Example:** "What is 5 × 7?"

---

### DOK Level 2: Skills & Concepts
- Apply skills and concepts
- Make decisions about how to approach a problem

**Example:** "Solve the word problem using the area formula."

---

### DOK Level 3: Strategic Thinking
- Reasoning, planning, evidence
- Multiple steps

**Example:** "Analyze the data and form a conclusion with supporting evidence."

---

### DOK Level 4: Extended Thinking
- Complex reasoning over time
- Real-world applications

**Example:** "Design and conduct an experiment, collect data, analyze results, and present findings."

---

## Rigor Distribution Guidelines

**Rigorous assessment minimum:**
- At least 50% of questions at Bloom's Level 3+ (Apply/Analyze/Evaluate/Create)
- At least 30% at Bloom's Level 4+ (Analyze/Evaluate/Create)

**Highly rigorous assessment:**
- 70%+ at Bloom's Level 3+
- 50%+ at Bloom's Level 4+

## Multiple-Choice Quality Checks

### Distractor Strength

- Include one **strong** distractor that mirrors a common misconception.
- Add one **medium** distractor that is partially correct or adjacent to the concept.
- Finish with one **weak** distractor that is still plausible but clearly wrong.
- This mix forces students to think instead of eliminating obvious answers.

### Answer Position Balance

- Track how often the correct answer appears in each position (A/B/C/D).
- Target roughly 25% in each slot; stay within a 20-30% band to avoid patterns.
- Shuffle positions manually if you notice streaks (e.g., `A, A, A`).

### No Inline Feedback

- Do not append “Feedback for…” lines beneath choices. Canvas New Quizzes manages feedback separately, and the parser rejects inline commentary.

---

## Question Variety Targets

- **Recall (Bloom 1-2):** ~20-30% to confirm foundational knowledge.
- **Application (Bloom 3):** ~30-40% to show transfer of learning.
- **Analysis/Evaluation (Bloom 4-5):** ~20-30% for deeper reasoning.
- **Creation (Bloom 6):** ~10-20% when the teacher explicitly wants synthesis.

Use these ranges as guardrails, not rigid quotas—adjust to match teacher intent.

---

## Tagging Questions by Level

**When generating quiz, note cognitive level in your planning:**

```
Question 1: MC - Bloom's Level 2 (Understand)
Question 2: MC - Bloom's Level 3 (Apply)
Question 3: MC - Bloom's Level 4 (Analyze)
Question 4: Essay - Bloom's Level 5 (Evaluate)
```

Verify distribution meets targets before finalizing.

## Summary

**Use this module when teachers explicitly want cognitive rigor frameworks. Otherwise, natural question variety in QF_BASE is sufficient.**
