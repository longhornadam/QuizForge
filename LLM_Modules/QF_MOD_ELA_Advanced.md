## Avoiding Under-Complexity

### ❌ Don't Ask Simple Recall

**Bad:**
```
Who is the main character?
```

**Good:**
```
How does the unreliable narrator complicate the reader's understanding of events?
```

---

### ✅ Ask Multi-Layered Questions

**Pattern: Effect + Purpose + Broader Implications**

```
How does the author's use of fragmented syntax in paragraph 3 mirror the 
protagonist's psychological state, and what does this suggest about the 
relationship between form and meaning in modernist literature?
```
