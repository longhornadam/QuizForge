# QuizForge Pedagogy Module: Reading Level Differentiation
**Multiple Passage Versions | Accessibility | Scaffolding**

---

## Overview

Create multiple versions of the same quiz at different reading levels while maintaining identical learning objectives and cognitive complexity.

**Key principle:** Scaffold the TEXT, not the THINKING.

**Load when:** Teacher requests "differentiated," "multiple reading levels," "below level," "advanced," or "struggling readers."

---

## Three-Tier Approach

### Below Level (2-3 years below grade)
- Shorter sentences (8-12 words average)
- High-frequency vocabulary
- Simpler sentence structures
- More scaffolding in questions

**Flesch-Kincaid targets:**
- Grade 6-8: FK 3.5-5.5
- Grade 9-12: FK 6.0-8.0

---

### On Level (Grade-appropriate)
- Standard sentence length (12-18 words average)
- Grade-level academic vocabulary
- Mix of simple and complex sentences

**Flesch-Kincaid targets:**
- Grade 6-8: FK 5.5-7.5
- Grade 9-12: FK 8.0-10.0

---

### Above Level (2-3 years above grade)
- Longer, complex sentences (15-25 words average)
- Advanced/specialized vocabulary
- Subordinate clauses and complex structures

**Flesch-Kincaid targets:**
- Grade 6-8: FK 8.0-10.0
- Grade 9-12: FK 10.0-12.0+

## Vocabulary Substitution Examples

| Above Level | On Level | Below Level |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| utilize | use | use |
| facilitate | help | help |
| subsequent | next | then |
| ambiguous | unclear | confusing |
| demonstrate | show | show |

## Passage Example: Three Levels

### Above Level
```
The phenomenon of bioluminescence involves a complex biochemical reaction 
wherein organisms produce and emit light through the oxidation of luciferin, 
catalyzed by the enzyme luciferase in the presence of molecular oxygen.
```

### On Level
```
Bioluminescence is when living organisms make light. This happens through 
a chemical reaction involving a substance called luciferin and an enzyme 
called luciferase, which need oxygen to work.
```

### Below Level
```
Some animals can make their own light. This is called bioluminescence. 
Special chemicals in their bodies mix together with oxygen. This makes light.
```

**Same concept, different reading complexity.**

## Question Adjustments

### Keep cognitive level SAME across all versions

**Below Level:**
```
Type: MC
Points: 8
Prompt:
Based on the passage, what do animals need to make light?

Choices:
- [ ] Water
- [x] Oxygen
- [ ] Food
- [ ] Sunlight
```

**On Level:**
```
Type: MC
Points: 8
Prompt:
According to the passage, what is required for bioluminescence to occur?

Choices:
- [ ] Water molecules
- [x] Oxygen
- [ ] Glucose
- [ ] Solar radiation
```

**Above Level:**
```
Type: MC
Points: 8
Prompt:
Based on the passage, which element is essential for the oxidation of 
luciferin in bioluminescent organisms?

Choices:
- [ ] Hydrogen
- [x] Oxygen
- [ ] Nitrogen
- [ ] Carbon
```

**All test the same knowledge; reading complexity varies.**

## When to Use Differentiation

**Use when:**
- Class has wide reading level range
- Inclusion classroom with diverse learners
- ELL students need simpler text
- Gifted students need challenge

**Don't use when:**
- All students at similar level
- Text complexity is part of learning objective
- Limited prep time (focus on content instead)

---

## Implementation Strategies

### Option 1: Three Separate Quizzes
- Create 3 versions of same quiz
- Assign appropriate version to each student
- Same learning objectives, different scaffolding

### Option 2: Tiered Questions
- Core questions for all students
- Advanced questions for above-level students
- Scaffolded questions for below-level students

---

## Summary

**Load this module only when teacher specifically requests differentiated reading levels. Most quizzes don't need this complexity.**
