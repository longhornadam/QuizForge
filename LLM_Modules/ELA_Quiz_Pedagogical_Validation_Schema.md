# ELA Quiz Pedagogical Validation Schema
**Grade 7 Reading Language Arts**

**Purpose:** This document establishes non-negotiable pedagogical standards for all quiz, assignment, and assessment construction. Use this schema at three stages: (1) co-authoring, (2) first validation, (3) final validation before QuizForge export.

**Document Status:** Living reference — update as pedagogy, standards, or TEKS alignment evolve.

## PART 1: ANSWER-CHOICE CONSTRUCTION RULES (Required)

Follow these rules for all multiple-choice and select-all-that-apply questions.

### 1.1 Correct-Answer Length Distribution (Quiz-Level)

Across the full quiz:

- The correct answer may be the longest choice **no more than 20–30% of the time.**
- The correct answer may be the shortest choice **no more than 20–30% of the time.**
- **In most questions, the correct answer should be middle-length relative to distractors.**

**Why this matters:** If students can spot the right answer by visual pattern alone (longest, shortest), they bypass the cognitive demand of the question. Length neutrality forces genuine reading and thinking.

---

### 1.2 Short Answers Exception

- **If all answer choices are one or two words, ignore length variance.**
- Do not pad or trim single-word or two-word answers.
- Students expect natural length differences at this scale.

**Example (compliant):**
```
What is the main character's motivation?
A) Revenge
B) Survival
C) Love
D) Power
```

**Example (non-compliant — over-padding):**
```
What is the main character's motivation?
A) To seek revenge against those who wronged him
B) Survival
C) Love
D) Power
```

---

### 1.2a Meta-Answer Exception

- **Answers that evaluate the full answer set — such as "All of the above," "None of the above," "No change is needed," or "All three sentences equally support the claim" — are exempt from length-variance rules (1.1 and 1.3).**
- These choices function differently from content-based answers. They ask students to assess the other options as a group, not to compare individual phrasings. Forcing them to match the word count of content answers would require artificial padding that adds confusion, not rigor.
- Do not pad meta-answers to match content-answer length.
- Do not count meta-answers when calculating length distribution across the quiz.
- Meta-answers are still subject to all other rules: plausibility (2.1), position distribution (1.6), and structural parity where applicable (1.4).

**Example (compliant — D is a meta-answer and exempt from length check):**
```
A student claims: "Honeybees have a major impact on the food supply." 
Which sentence from the passage BEST supports this claim?

A) "Honeybees are essential to agriculture."
B) "A single hive can pollinate up to 300 million flowers per day."
C) "Without bees, crops like almonds, blueberries, and apples would produce significantly less fruit."
D) All three sentences equally support the claim.
```
D is shorter than C, but this is expected. D asks the student to evaluate all three options — its length is structurally different by nature.

**Example (compliant — D is "No change" in an editing question):**
```
Which change, if any, should be made to this sentence?

A) Remove the comma after "campfire"
B) Change "crackling" to "crackled"
C) Change "night" to "Night"
D) No change is needed
```
D is shorter than A–C, but "No change is needed" is a fixed meta-answer. Do not pad it.

---

### 1.3 Length Control for Phrases & Sentences

If any answer choice is three or more words:

- **All answer choices must be similar in length (roughly within ±10–12% of each other).**
- No answer should visually stand out as noticeably longer or shorter.
- Count words: if one answer is 8 words and another is 2 words, revise.

**Example (compliant):**
```
The author uses dialogue in paragraph 5 primarily to—
A) reveal the character's inner conflict
B) develop a sense of tension between peers
C) demonstrate the setting's isolation
D) establish the narrator's perspective
```
All answers are 4–5 words. Similar length, different meaning.

**Example (non-compliant — answer C is too short):**
```
The author uses dialogue in paragraph 5 primarily to—
A) reveal the character's inner conflict about her identity
B) develop a sense of mounting tension between the two friends
C) establish mood
D) show how the protagonist's worldview has changed
```
Answer C stands out visually and might cue low-performing readers.

---

### 1.4 Structural Parity (Always Required for 3+ Words)

When answers are phrases or sentences:

- **All choices must share the same grammatical structure** (e.g., all noun phrases, all verb phrases, all complete sentences, all prepositional phrases).
- Do not mix:
  - Abstract generalizations with concrete details
  - Sentence fragments with full sentences
  - Definitions with examples
  - Active voice with passive voice (unless the passive construction is required by the text)

**Example (compliant — all noun phrases):**
```
The setting in "Winter Wisdom" serves to—
A) establish a mood of warmth and tradition
B) highlight the tension between youth and age
C) emphasize the importance of family bonds
D) contrast urban isolation with domestic comfort
```

**Example (non-compliant — mixed structures):**
```
The setting in "Winter Wisdom" serves to—
A) establish a mood of warmth and tradition
B) the grandmother's role as a guide
C) emphasize the importance of family bonds
D) show how seasons change
```
Answer B is a noun phrase, A and C are prepositional phrases, D is a verb phrase. Inconsistent.

---

### 1.5 Revision Rule

If an answer choice violates these rules:

- **Revise wording, not meaning.**
- Prefer small structural adjustments over adding filler or removing clarity.
- Never sacrifice accuracy to meet length constraints.

**Example:**

**Original (non-compliant):**
```
A) The grandmother taught Emi patience and mindfulness through the practice of origami
B) Love
C) Art
D) Family
```
Answer A is too long; others are one word. Revision options:

**Option 1 (revise A, keep meaning):**
```
A) the value of patience and mindfulness
B) the importance of love
C) the purpose of artistic expression
D) the bonds of family
```
Now all are noun phrases of similar length.

**Option 2 (revise others to match A's complexity — if A is worth the complexity):**
```
A) the cultivation of patience through focused practice
B) the expression of love through shared moments
C) the role of art in personal growth
D) the strength found in family traditions
```
All now parallel in structure and length.

---

### 1.6 Final Self-Check (Before Output)

Before finalizing the quiz, confirm:

- ✓ No visual pattern reveals the correct answer
- ✓ Students must rely on meaning, not shape, to choose correctly
- ✓ All distractors are plausible alternatives
- ✓ Correct answers vary in position across the quiz
- ✓ No answer choice is obviously inferior to others

---

## PART 2: DISTRACTOR QUALITY & MISCONCEPTION ALIGNMENT (Required)

Your rules are only as strong as the wrong answers. This section ensures distractors teach, not confuse.

### 2.1 Plausibility Standard

Every distractor must be a believable error a student could make.

- **Avoid random, nonsensical options.** They do not assess understanding; they pad the quiz.
- **Distractors should reflect common misconceptions, partial knowledge, or related concepts.**
- Each distractor should be defensible in isolation—if a student saw only that answer, they should think "this could be right."

**Example (compliant):**
```
What inference can you make about Emi's grandmother based on paragraph 3?
A) She values tradition and connection [CORRECT]
B) She prefers spending time alone [MISCONCEPTION: confuses solitude with preference]
C) She uses origami as punishment [MISCONCEPTION: misreads tone]
D) She is afraid of change [MISCONCEPTION: confuses caution with fear]
```
Each distractor reflects a misreading a real 7th grader might make.

**Example (non-compliant):**
```
What inference can you make about Emi's grandmother based on paragraph 3?
A) She values tradition and connection [CORRECT]
B) She is a llama [RANDOM]
C) She uses origami as punishment [MISCONCEPTION: misreads tone]
D) The sun is yellow [RANDOM]
```
Options B and D are nonsense. Students don't learn from these; they just eliminate noise.

---

### 2.2 Distractor Diversity

All distractors must differ meaningfully from each other.

- Do not include two near-identical wrong answers.
- Each distractor should target a different misconception or reading error.
- If two distractors feel interchangeable, delete one and replace it with a more distinct misconception.

**Example (non-compliant — B and C are too similar):**
```
Why does the author describe the origami sessions in such detail?
A) to show the passage of time
B) to emphasize the importance of the grandmother's teachings [DISTRACTOR 1]
C) to highlight how valuable the grandmother's lessons were [DISTRACTOR 2]
D) to prove that winter is a good season
```
Distractors B and C say nearly the same thing. A student who eliminates one will likely eliminate the other.

**Example (compliant — each distractor targets a different misconception):**
```
Why does the author describe the origami sessions in such detail?
A) to show the passage of time [MISCONCEPTION: confuses detail with narrative structure]
B) to demonstrate that the grandmother was an expert artist [MISCONCEPTION: confuses skill with purpose]
C) to explain why Emi stopped visiting her grandmother [MISCONCEPTION: confuses effect with cause]
D) to illustrate how simple moments hold lasting meaning [CORRECT]
```

---

### 2.3 Misconception Mapping

If possible, label each distractor with the misconception it targets. This helps during revision and ensures rigor.

**Format for internal documentation (not shown to students):**

```
Question: Based on the narrator's tone in paragraph 6, what does she realize about 
          her grandmother's advice?

A) The advice was impractical and outdated
   [MISCONCEPTION: Student conflates nostalgia with dismissal]

B) The advice applies only to origami, not to life
   [MISCONCEPTION: Student limits scope of lesson; misses metaphor]

C) The advice has value and relevance to her current struggles
   [CORRECT]

D) The advice was meant to keep her busy when she was young
   [MISCONCEPTION: Student misreads grandmother's intent as distraction, not teaching]
```

---

### 2.4 Distractor-Answer Balance

No distractor should be obviously worse than the correct answer.

- **All wrong answers should be defensible if taken out of context.**
- Avoid "trap answers" that sound sophisticated but are factually wrong (unless the question explicitly tests whether students can distinguish sophisticated-sounding from accurate).
- Each distractor should demonstrate partial knowledge or a common reasoning error, not ignorance.

**Example (non-compliant — B is clearly inferior):**
```
What does "pristine" mean in paragraph 6 of "Winter Wisdom"?
A) perfectly clean and intact [CORRECT]
B) smells like flowers [obviously wrong]
C) newly made [partial knowledge]
D) undamaged [synonym — strong distractor]
```

**Example (compliant — all answers reflect possible reasoning):**
```
What does "pristine" mean in paragraph 6 of "Winter Wisdom"?
A) perfectly clean and intact [CORRECT — full definition]
B) very old and valuable [MISCONCEPTION: confuses pristine with ancient/precious]
C) carefully preserved [PARTIAL KNOWLEDGE: true but incomplete]
D) brand new [PARTIAL KNOWLEDGE: overlaps but emphasizes newness over condition]
```

---

## PART 3: CONTEXT & SELF-CONTAINMENT (Required)

Questions must stand alone or be explicitly linked to a stimulus. Ambiguity kills validity.

### 3.1 Self-Contained Questions

**Every question must be answerable without reference to an external passage, unless it is explicitly marked as stimulus-dependent.**

**Example (non-compliant — assumes student has read "Winter Wisdom" passage):**
```
According to paragraph 3, why does the author enjoy drinking hot tea?
[No passage provided; student must have text memorized or in front of them]
```

**Example (compliant — self-contained):**
```
In "Winter Wisdom," the narrator drinks hot tea primarily to—
A) stay warm during winter
B) be more like her grandmother
C) improve her health
D) avoid drinking hot cocoa
[Question includes context; no external passage required to answer]
```

---

### 3.2 Stimulus-Linked Questions

If a question **requires** a stimulus passage:

- **Mark it explicitly in quiz metadata:** `[REQUIRES STIMULUS: "Winter Wisdom"]`
- **Place it immediately after the passage** in the quiz structure.
- **Ensure the stimulus is provided** in the quiz platform (Canvas, QuizForge, etc.).
- **Do NOT assume** students have read the passage separately or have it in front of them.

**Compliant stimulus-linked question structure:**

```
STIMULUS (provided in quiz):
---
Growing up, I always spent nonschool days at my grandparents' house. It was a small, 
quiet home with a well-manicured lawn and a clothesline in the backyard. I spent most 
of the summertime outside, running through freshly laundered clothes that had just been 
hung to dry, climbing my grandparents' big oak tree, or lying in the grass counting 
ladybugs.
---

QUESTION (linked to stimulus):
Based on the description in the passage, what can you infer about the narrator's 
childhood summers?
A) They were boring and uneventful
B) They were carefree and imaginative
C) They were isolated and lonely
D) They were carefully controlled by her grandmother
```

---

### 3.3 Vocabulary-in-Context

If defining a rare or content-specific word, provide minimal context inline.

**Example (non-compliant — no context):**
```
What is the best definition of "comforted"?
A) consoled
B) supported
C) ignored
D) challenged
```
Without context, students guess. This tests vocabulary, not reading comprehension.

**Example (compliant — context provided):**
```
In the sentence "In that moment, I was no longer alone. Instead, I was comforted by 
the memory of my grandmother," the word "comforted" most likely means—
A) made to feel at ease and supported
B) physically wrapped in warmth
C) distracted from sadness
D) reminded of the past
```
Context allows students to use inference + vocabulary, not just memorization.

---

## PART 4: COGNITIVE RIGOR & BLOOM'S ALIGNMENT (Required)

Ensure every question matches its intended instructional purpose. TEKS alignment requires rigor intentionality.

### 4.1 Three Tiers of Cognitive Demand

#### **Tier 1: Recall/Recognition (Bloom's 1–2)**

Students retrieve a single fact, recognize a definition, or identify a concrete detail.

- **TEKS examples:** 7.2(A), 7.2(B), 7.2(C), 7.4(A)
- **Question types:** Who, What, When, Where (explicit recall)
- **Example questions:**
  - "What is the narrator's grandmother's name in 'Winter Wisdom'?"
  - "Which of the following is a synonym for 'origami'?"
  - "In paragraph 2, what season does the narrator mention?"

**Expected for:** vocabulary checks, fact recall, foundational comprehension.

---

#### **Tier 2: Application/Analysis (Bloom's 3–4)**

Students apply a concept, analyze relationships, explain cause/effect, or make inferences.

- **TEKS examples:** 7.5(E), 7.5(F), 7.5(G), 7.6(C), 7.6(D), 7.9(A), 7.9(F)
- **Question types:** How, Why, What is the effect of, What does this reveal, Infer
- **Example questions:**
  - "Why does the author describe the origami sessions in detail?"
  - "How does Emi's attitude toward origami change throughout the text?"
  - "What inference can you make about the grandmother's character based on her dialogue?"

**Expected for:** comprehension checks, skill practice, formative assessments.

---

#### **Tier 3: Synthesis/Evaluation (Bloom's 5–6)**

Students justify a position, evaluate multiple sources, defend a claim, or synthesize across texts.

- **TEKS examples:** 7.8(D), 7.8(E), 7.9(B), 7.9(D), 7.9(G), 7.11(B), 7.11(C)
- **Question types:** Evaluate, Justify, Compare across texts, Defend, Predict consequences
- **Example questions:**
  - "Which piece of evidence best supports the claim that the grandmother's teachings are universal?"
  - "How would the story change if Emi had refused to learn origami?"
  - "Compare the grandfather's role in 'Winter Wisdom' with the grandmother's. Which character has more influence on the narrator?"

**Expected for:** extension tasks, summative assessments, ECRs, deeper analysis.

---

### 4.2 Tier Distribution by Quiz Purpose

**Formative Quiz (low-stakes, practice):**
- 60% Tier 2 (application/analysis)
- 30% Tier 1 (recall)
- 10% Tier 3 (synthesis)

**Standard Unit Quiz (moderate stakes, skill check):**
- 40% Tier 2 (application/analysis)
- 30% Tier 1 (recall)
- 30% Tier 3 (synthesis)

**Summative Test (high stakes, mastery assessment):**
- 20% Tier 2 (application/analysis)
- 20% Tier 1 (recall)
- 60% Tier 3 (synthesis/evaluation)

---

### 4.3 Tier Consistency Check

Before finalizing a quiz:

- **Document the intended tier** for each question in the quiz metadata or comment section.
- **Verify distribution** against the quiz's purpose (formative, standard, summative).
- **Flag misalignments:** If a Tier 1 question appears on a summative test, or a Tier 3 question on a formative quiz without purpose, revise or justify.

**Example metadata notation (for internal reference):**

```
Q1: What is the narrator's main conflict in "Winter Wisdom"? [Tier 2]
Q2: Define "comforted." [Tier 1]
Q3: Which evidence best supports the claim that the narrator's relationship 
    with her grandmother was transformative? [Tier 3]
```

---

## PART 5: WORDING & LANGUAGE SAFETY (Required)

Clear, precise wording protects student understanding and prevents unintended misreads.

### 5.1 Avoid Absolute Language in Distractors

**Bad practice:** Use absolute language in wrong answers to make them obviously incorrect.

**Example (non-compliant — distractor is obviously wrong):**
```
What does the grandmother teach Emi about patience?
A) Patience is essential for meaningful work [CORRECT]
B) Patience is NEVER useful in modern life [OBVIOUSLY WRONG — too absolute]
C) Patience applies only to art [MISCONCEPTION — too narrow]
D) Patience is pointless [OBVIOUSLY WRONG — too absolute]
```

**Better practice:** Soften wrong answers with qualifiers so they remain plausible.

**Example (compliant — all distractors are defensible):**
```
What does the grandmother teach Emi about patience?
A) Patience is essential for meaningful work [CORRECT]
B) Patience is often less important than speed in modern life [MISCONCEPTION — plausible misreading]
C) Patience applies primarily to artistic pursuits [MISCONCEPTION — too narrow]
D) Patience may reduce productivity in some situations [MISCONCEPTION — inverts priority]
```

**Rule:** Use "often," "may," "can," "typically," "usually" in distractors. Avoid "always," "never," "only," "impossible."

---

### 5.2 Negative Questions (Use Sparingly)

**Bad practice:** Overuse questions that ask what is NOT true, what EXCEPT, etc. These create cognitive confusion.

**Example (non-compliant):**
```
Which is NOT a reason the narrator's grandmother taught her origami?
```
Students must hold multiple pieces of information in memory, reverse logic, and then choose. Unnecessary difficulty.

**Better practice:** Phrase questions positively. If you must use negative:

- **Capitalize NOT or use ALL CAPS:** "Which is NOT a reason…" or "Which EXCEPT statement…"
- **Limit to 1 per quiz maximum.**
- **Do NOT combine with complex sentence structures.**
- **Always justify in quiz metadata why the negative phrasing was necessary.**

**Example (compliant use of negative):**
```
The author does NOT describe the grandfather's role in the story. What can you 
infer from this omission?
A) The grandfather was unimportant to the narrator's development
B) The author deliberately focused on female mentorship
C) The narrator had no relationship with her grandfather
D) The story would be too long if the grandfather were included

[Justification: This question directly assesses inference about narrative choice, 
which is Tier 3 TEKS 7.9(G). Positive phrasing would weaken the question.]
```

---

### 5.3 Qualifiers: "Best," "Most Likely," "Most Accurately"

Use precise qualifiers so students know what to compare.

- **"Best"** = highest quality, most effective, most beneficial
- **"Most likely"** = most probable based on evidence or context
- **"Most accurately"** = factually correct, most precise
- **"Primarily"** = main or most important reason/effect
- **"Mainly"** = dominant but not exclusive

**Example (imprecise):**
```
The author uses dialogue in paragraph 5 to—
A) show the characters' emotions [TOO VAGUE]
```

**Example (precise):**
```
The author uses dialogue in paragraph 5 primarily to—
A) reveal the characters' conflicting emotions
[Now students know we're looking for the MAIN purpose, not all possible purposes]
```

---

## PART 6: ACCESSIBILITY & UDL GUARDRAILS (Required)

**Note:** Answer-position randomization is handled by QuizForge and Canvas LMS and is not addressed in this schema.

Ensure questions are accessible to all learners, including ELL, SpEd, and on-level students.

## PART 6: ACCESSIBILITY & UDL GUARDRAILS (Required)

- **Avoid idioms, colloquialisms, or culture-specific references** without context.
  - ❌ "The grandmother's advice was a breath of fresh air."
  - ✓ "The grandmother's advice brought new hope to the narrator."

- **Use active voice; keep sentences ≤ 25 words.**
  - ❌ "The grandmother, who had always been respected by her family and who taught the narrator important lessons through the practice of origami, is a character whose influence on the story cannot be overstated."
  - ✓ "The grandmother teaches the narrator patience through origami. Her influence on the narrator's life is central to the story."

- **Define discipline-specific jargon on first use.**
  - ❌ "What does the playwright's use of rising action accomplish?"
  - ✓ "In drama, rising action is the series of events that build tension. What does the playwright accomplish with rising action in this play?"

---

### 6.2 Visual & Cognitive Load

- **No question should include more than 2 subordinate clauses.**
  - ❌ "When the narrator realizes, because she discovers the purple paper that was hidden under her books, that her grandmother's wisdom applies to her present struggles, what does this moment reveal?"
  - ✓ "The narrator finds the purple paper and begins to fold origami. What does this moment reveal about her character?"

- **Break complex questions into simpler components when possible.**
  - ❌ Single MCQ combining three ideas
  - ✓ Multiple separate questions, each focused on one idea

- **Avoid ALL-CAPS except for acronyms.**
  - ❌ "WHAT IS THE MAIN IDEA OF THE PASSAGE?"
  - ✓ "What is the main idea of the passage?"

---

### 6.3 ELL & Special Needs Consideration

- **Tier 1 questions should dominate in scaffolded/modified quizzes** for students with significant language support needs.
- **Provide word banks or simplified distractors in differentiated quizzes.**
  - ❌ Same quiz for all students, no accommodations
  - ✓ Differentiated versions with word banks for Tier 1 students, simplified language for ELL

- **Flag culturally loaded or socioeconomically biased language.**
  - ❌ Reference to expensive summer camps, international travel, or specific cultural celebrations without context
  - ✓ Ensure examples use universal experiences or provide cultural context

---

## PART 7: PRE-OUTPUT VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**Use this checklist immediately before uploading to QuizForge or Canvas.**

### Quiz-Level Validation

- [ ] **Self-containment:** All questions are self-contained OR explicitly marked as stimulus-linked with stimulus provided
- [ ] **Answer-choice length:** Correct-answer length complies with 20–30% rule; no visual pattern reveals the answer
- [ ] **Answer-choice structure:** All 3+ word answers share grammatical structure (no mixed fragments/sentences)
- [ ] **Distractor quality:** All distractors are plausible misconceptions, not random errors
- [ ] **Distractor diversity:** No distractor repeats or duplicates; each targets a different misconception
- [ ] **Distractor balance:** No distractor is obviously inferior; all are defensible
- [ ] **Cognitive tiers:** Each question is labeled with tier; distribution matches quiz purpose
- [ ] **TEKS alignment:** Each question maps to at least one prioritized TEKS for the unit/subunit
- [ ] **Answer position:** Correct answers randomize across A/B/C/D; no position repeats >2 times consecutively
- [ ] **Negative language:** No NOT/EXCEPT questions OR all NOT/EXCEPT are justified in metadata
- [ ] **Absolute language:** Distractors use qualifiers (often, may, can) not absolutes (always, never)
- [ ] **Qualifiers:** Questions use precise qualifiers (best, most likely, primarily)
- [ ] **Vocabulary context:** Rare/new words include inline context or word bank
- [ ] **Language clarity:** No idioms, sentence length <25 words, jargon defined
- [ ] **Cognitive load:** No question has >2 subordinate clauses
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Content is accessible to ELL and SpEd students; no cultural bias without context
- [ ] **Rationales:** If ECR, rationales are student-facing, complete, and stand-alone (no "ask your teacher")

### Question-Level Validation (Spot-Check 3–5 Questions)

For each spot-checked question:

- [ ] Reading the correct answer out loud: Does it sound natural (not robotic or padded)?
- [ ] Reading a distractor out loud: Would a student who misunderstands the concept choose this?
- [ ] Covering the correct answer: Can I identify it by looking at the distractors, or must I read all carefully?
- [ ] Removing the question from context: Can I still answer it (or does it require the passage)?

---

## PART 8: WORKFLOW FOR QUIZ CONSTRUCTION

This section clarifies the three-stage process: co-authoring → validation → revision → final validation → QuizForge.

### Stage 1: Co-Authoring (Markdown → Quiz Structure)

**What you do:**
1. Write questions in shared Markdown (or directly in QuizForge Base DRAFT).
2. For each question:
   - Write the prompt/stem
   - List 4 answer choices (or 2–4 for true/false, matching, etc.)
   - Label the correct answer (*)
3. Include minimal metadata: question number, TEKS code, intended tier

**Example format:**

```markdown
## Q1: Character Analysis (7.7.B) [Tier 2]
What does Emi's initial reaction to origami sessions reveal about her character?

A) She is dismissive of her grandmother's interests
B) She feels honored and eager to participate (*)
C) She resents being forced to spend time indoors
D) She is secretly afraid of making mistakes

---

## Q2: Vocabulary in Context (7.2.B) [Tier 1]
In paragraph 3, the word "snippets" most nearly means—

A) small pieces or fragments (*)
B) quick conversations
C) sharp tools
D) brief moments in time
```

**Validation at this stage:** N/A (content is still being developed)

---

### Stage 2: First Validation (Self-Check by Authoring Teacher)

**What the authoring teacher does:**
1. Read through ALL questions holistically.
2. Run through the **Pre-Output Validation Checklist** (Part 8).
3. Mark questions that fail validation with `[FLAG]`.
4. Add comments explaining what needs revision.

**Example flagged question:**

```markdown
## Q5: Inference (7.5.F) [Tier 3]
[FLAG: Length variance, weak distractor diversity]

Why does the author choose to describe the origami sessions through the narrator's 
adult perspective rather than as events happening in real time?

A) The narrator is older and can reflect on the meaning of these moments with greater understanding (*)
B) Adult perspectives are more reliable than child perspectives
C) The author wanted to make the story shorter and easier to read
D) Real-time narrative is less interesting to readers

[Comment: A is 18 words; B is 9 words; C is 13 words; D is 8 words. 
Revision: Standardize lengths. Also, B and D are too weak—revise to stronger misconceptions.]
```

---

### Stage 3: Revision (Authoring Teacher Addresses Flags)

**What the authoring teacher does:**
1. For each flagged question, revise according to the schema.
2. Re-check against the validation criteria.
3. Remove `[FLAG]` once resolved.
4. Add rationale/explanation if length or structure changed significantly.

**Example revision:**

```markdown
## Q5: Inference (7.5.F) [Tier 3]
[REVISED & CLEARED]

Why does the author choose to describe the origami sessions through the narrator's 
adult perspective rather than as events happening in real time?

A) The adult narrator can reflect on the deeper meaning of simple moments (*)
B) The author uses time shifts to show how the narrator's values have changed
C) Adult narrators are generally more objective than child narrators
D) Reflective narration makes the story easier for readers to follow

[Revision notes: A = 11 words, B = 13 words, C = 9 words, D = 10 words 
(all within ±10%). Each distractor now targets a distinct misconception. ✓]
```

---

### Stage 4: Final Validation (Second Reader or Instructional Coach)

**What the validator does:**
1. Read through revised questions as a student would (without answers).
2. Predict what a student at each tier (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) would choose.
3. Verify that the correct answer is defensible for its tier.
4. Check for any new issues (ambiguity, bias, etc.).
5. Approve with signature or checkmark, or flag for further revision.

**Validation sign-off example:**

```
FINAL VALIDATION — Grade 7 "Winter Wisdom" Quiz
Validator: [Instructional Coach Name]
Date: [Date]
Status: APPROVED with 1 minor note

Note: Q7 uses "primarily" but Q8 uses "mainly." Prefer consistency; recommend 
standardizing to "primarily" across all intent-based questions.

Approved for QuizForge export: [Signature/Initials]
```

---

### Stage 5: QuizForge Export

Only after **both the authoring teacher AND the validator** have signed off, export to QuizForge.

QuizForge will:
- Validate TEKS alignment
- Assign default point values (unless teacher specifies)
- Generate QTI format for Canvas
- Shuffle answer positions (if configured)

---

## PART 9: SPECIAL CASES & EXCEPTIONS

### Short Constructed Response (SCR) Validation

SCRs (text-based, 1–3 sentence responses) follow the same rigor tiers but skip answer-choice rules (Parts 1–2).

**Validation checklist for SCRs:**
- [ ] Question stem is clear and self-contained
- [ ] Stem specifies evidence requirement ("support with evidence from the text")
- [ ] Expected answer(s) are defensible (multiple valid responses ok)
- [ ] Tier is appropriate for quiz purpose
- [ ] Rubric (2-point, 3-point, etc.) is clearly labeled

**Example SCR:**

```
Based on the text, explain how Emi's understanding of her grandmother's advice changes 
over time. Support your response with evidence from the passage.

[2-point rubric: 2 = clear change identified with relevant evidence; 
1 = change or evidence present but incomplete; 0 = little/no understanding]
```

---

### Extended Constructed Response (ECR) Validation

ECRs (essays, 3+ paragraphs) follow the ECR rubric (separate document) but must also include:

- [ ] Clear controlling idea/thesis requirement
- [ ] Evidence expectations (number of pieces, type: direct quote vs. paraphrase)
- [ ] Organization expectations (introduction, body, conclusion)
- [ ] Language/conventions expectations (grade-level appropriate)
- [ ] Rationales that address each rubric criterion

**Example ECR validation note:**

```
ECR: Correspondence Writing
[Validated for 7.11.D — Compose correspondence; 7.6.C — Use text evidence]

Prompt: Write a letter to the Maple Street police department expressing your opinion 
on whether Charlie should be charged with Pete's death. Support your claim with 
evidence from "The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street."

Evidence expectation: Minimum 2 direct quotes or paraphrased details
Organization: Proper letter format (greeting, body, closing)
Rubric: 5-point ECR (3 for development/organization, 2 for conventions)

Tier: 3 (Synthesis/Evaluation — students must evaluate evidence and justify position)
Status: APPROVED
```

- Standard passage length
- No scaffolds
- Mix of recall, analysis, synthesis

Version C (Accelerated): 12 questions, Tier 2–3 focus
- Longer, more complex passages
- Cross-text comparisons
- Application to new contexts

All versions aligned to: 7.5.F, 7.6.C, 7.7.B, 7.8.C

## PART 10: COMMON PITFALLS & HOW TO AVOID THEM

| **Pitfall** | **Sign** | **Fix** |
|---|---|---|
| **Length-biased answers** | Correct answer is longest 40% of the time | Count words; revise A–D to similar lengths (±10%) |
| **Weak distractors** | Students who don't read still get 50%+ correct | Replace distractors with real misconceptions; use internal distractor mapping |
| **Unclear stems** | Teachers must re-read questions to understand them | Read stem aloud; if you stumble, rewrite to <25 words |
| **Tier mismatch** | Formative quiz has 60% Tier 3 questions | Recount tiers; revise complex questions to simpler versions OR move to unit test |
| **Answer-position patterns** | Correct answer in position B for 5 questions straight | Shuffle answers; count positions before finalizing |
| **Context-dependent but unlabeled** | Student can't answer because passage isn't provided | Mark as [REQUIRES STIMULUS]; ensure stimulus is embedded in quiz |
| **Mixed grammar** | Some answers are fragments, others full sentences | Revise all answers to match structure (all noun phrases, all complete sentences, etc.) |
| **Absolute language** | Distractors say "NEVER" or "ALWAYS" | Soften with qualifiers: "often," "may," "typically" |
| **Too much cognitive load** | Single question with 3 clauses and 40 words | Break into multiple questions; simplify sentence structure |
| **Ratio imbalance** | Quiz has 20 MC, 1 SCR, 1 ECR (time-heavy) | Plan balance: formative = mostly MC + 1 SCR; summative = MC + SCR + ECR |

## PART 11: VERSION HISTORY & UPDATES

| **Date** | **Version** | **Change** | **Author** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025-01-29 | 1.0 | Initial schema; Parts 1–12 complete | [Teacher Name] |
| 2025-02-08 | 1.1 | Added §1.2a Meta-Answer Exception — "All of the above," "None of the above," "No change is needed," and similar full-set evaluation answers are now exempt from length-variance rules (1.1, 1.3). These answers are structurally different from content answers and should not be padded or trimmed to match. All other rules still apply. | [Teacher Name] |
