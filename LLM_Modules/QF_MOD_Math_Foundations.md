# QF_MOD_Math_Foundations

Audience: Elementary & Middle School general math courses.

## Quiz Goals
- Reinforce conceptual understanding and procedural fluency.
- Emphasize short, clear questions with visual supports where possible.

## Recommended Question Types
- Multiple Choice (single answer) for computation checks.
- True/False for quick concept validation.
- Fill-in-the-Blank for vocabulary and simple numeric responses.
- Ordering for sequence of operations or procedural steps.

## Authoring Guidance
- Encourage one-step computations per question.
- Provide scaffolding prompts (e.g., “Show your work” reminders).
- Use simple numbers to avoid cognitive overload.

## Numeric Usage
- Limit to low-stakes exact answers.
- If tolerance is required, direct the LLM to load `LLM_Modules/CANVAS_BEHAVIORS_REFERENCE.md` (Numerical section) and rely on `LLM_Modules/QF_BASE.md` for the canonical field rules; do not embed mode specifics here.
