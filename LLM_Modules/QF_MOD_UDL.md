# QuizForge Pedagogy Module: Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
**Accessibility | Multiple Means of Engagement, Representation, Expression**

---

## Overview

UDL principles for creating accessible assessments that work for diverse learners, including students with disabilities, ELL students, and varied learning preferences.

**Load when:** Teacher mentions "accessibility," "accommodations," "UDL," "diverse learners," or "special education."

## UDL Principle 1: Multiple Means of Engagement

**Provide options for sustaining effort and persistence**

### Vary question types to maintain engagement
- Mix MC, TF, essay, matching
- Break long quizzes into sections
- Include real-world scenarios

### Allow choice where possible
```
Type: ESSAY
Points: 20
Prompt:
Choose ONE of the following prompts:

A) Explain how the water cycle works using a diagram
B) Write a story from the perspective of a water droplet going through the cycle
C) Compare the water cycle to the rock cycle

(5-8 sentences)
```

---

## UDL Principle 2: Multiple Means of Representation

**Present information in multiple formats**

### Text + Visual Descriptions
```
Type: STIMULUS
Prompt:
Study the diagram of a plant cell (described below):

>>>
The cell contains:
- Cell wall (outer boundary)
- Cell membrane (inside cell wall)
- Nucleus (center, contains DNA)
- Chloroplasts (green, make food)
- Vacuole (large storage area)
- Mitochondria (small ovals, make energy)
>>>
```

**Note:** Describe visual content in text for screen readers.

---

### Reduce Cognitive Load
- Break complex questions into parts
- Use clear, simple language
- Avoid unnecessary wordiness

**Bad:**
```
Given the aforementioned information pertaining to the experiment, 
what conclusion can be drawn regarding the hypothesis?
```

**Good:**
```
Based on the experiment results, is the hypothesis supported?
```

---

## UDL Principle 3: Multiple Means of Expression

**Allow students to demonstrate knowledge in different ways**

### Options for showing work
```
Type: ESSAY
Points: 15
Prompt:
Explain how photosynthesis works.

**You may:**
- Write a paragraph explanation (5-8 sentences)
- Create a labeled diagram with captions
- Upload a video explanation (1-2 minutes)
- Record an audio explanation

Choose the format that works best for you.
```

---

### File Upload for alternative formats
```
Type: FILEUPLOAD
Points: 20
Prompt:
Demonstrate your understanding of the rock cycle.

**Options:**
- Written report (2-3 pages)
- Illustrated poster (upload photo)
- Video presentation (2-3 minutes)
- Audio recording with visuals

All formats must explain the three types of rocks and how they transform.
```

## Accessibility Checklist

### ✅ Text Accessibility
- [ ] Use sans-serif fonts (easier to read)
- [ ] Avoid all-caps text (harder to read)
- [ ] Use straight quotes, not smart quotes
- [ ] Describe visual content in text

### ✅ Question Clarity
- [ ] One concept per question
- [ ] Clear, concise language
- [ ] Avoid double negatives
- [ ] Define technical terms on first use

### ✅ Scaffolding
- [ ] Break complex tasks into steps
- [ ] Provide examples when helpful
- [ ] Include word banks for FITB (optional)
- [ ] Allow reference materials if appropriate

## Accommodations Support

### Extended Time
**Canvas handles this separately** - no changes needed in quiz design

### Read-Aloud Support
**Screen reader friendly:**
- Use text descriptions for all visuals
- Avoid relying solely on formatting (bold, italics)
- Use clear headings and structure

### Reduced Anxiety
- Use encouraging language in feedback
- Avoid high-stakes single questions
- Break into smaller chunks

**Example feedback:**
```
Not quite. The cell wall is the outer layer. Review the diagram and try again 
- you've got this!
```

---

## Language Learner Support (ELL)

### Vocabulary Support
- Define academic terms in context
- Use simpler synonyms in below-level versions
- Provide word banks for FITB questions

**Example with word bank:**
```
Type: FITB
Points: 8
Prompt:
The process plants use to make food is called [answer].

**Word bank:** photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration, germination

Acceptable:
photosynthesis
```

---

### Reduce Language Complexity
- Shorter sentences
- Active voice (not passive)
- Common vocabulary when possible

**Passive voice (harder):**
```
The experiment was conducted by the scientists.
```

**Active voice (easier):**
```
The scientists conducted the experiment.
```
