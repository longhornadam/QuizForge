but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses 
--not destroyed --not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute.

[2] I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things 
in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily --how 
calmly I can tell you the whole story.
