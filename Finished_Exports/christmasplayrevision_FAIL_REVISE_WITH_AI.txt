VALIDATION ERRORS DETECTED
============================================================

The quiz 'christmasplayrevision' has critical errors that must be fixed
before it can be processed. Please fix the following issues:

1. Parse error: Invalid JSON payload: the JSON could not be parsed. The parser stopped at line 92, column 66 with 'Expecting ',' delimiter', which usually means a missing comma or an unescaped double quote inside a string. Fix the JSON syntax around that spot so it becomes valid.
Context:
0092: { "id": "A", "text": "During the Christmas play, the choir sang "Silent Night."", "correct": true },
                                                                       ^
2. String ending at line 92, column 68 is followed by 'S' (line 92, column 69) without a comma/colon; likely a missing comma or an unescaped quote inside the string.
3. Invalid token 'S' at line 92, column 70; not valid JSON syntax.
4. String ending at line 94, column 68 is followed by 's' (line 94, column 69) without a comma/colon; likely a missing comma or an unescaped quote inside the string.
5. Invalid token 's' at line 94, column 70; not valid JSON syntax.

============================================================

"item_id": "q1",
"correct": "The subject is plural (actors), so it must take the plural verb are, not is.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because is is a singular verb and does not agree with the plural subject actors."
},
{
"item_id": "q2",
"correct": "A run-on can be corrected by separating two complete thoughts with a comma and coordinating conjunction (comma + and).",
"distractor": "Choice C is incorrect because it still runs two independent clauses together without proper punctuation or a conjunction."
},
{
"item_id": "q3",
"correct": "A complete sentence needs a subject and a verb that form a complete thought, which this option has.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because it is a dependent clause starting with when, so it cannot stand alone."
},
{
"item_id": "q4",
"correct": "In a compound sentence, a comma is used before the coordinating conjunction that joins two independent clauses.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because the comma is placed after and, which breaks the sentence incorrectly."
},
{
"item_id": "q5",
"correct": "There shows existence (There are), while their shows possession and they're means they are.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because their is possessive and cannot replace there in a sentence about existence."
},
{
"item_id": "q6",
"correct": "Its shows possession, while it's is a contraction for it is or it has, so the possessive form is needed here.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because it's means it is, which does not make sense in a sentence showing possession."
},
{
"item_id": "q7",
"correct": "Affect is usually a verb meaning influence, and effect is usually a noun meaning result.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because it swaps the common parts of speech by using effect as a verb and affect as a noun."
},
{
"item_id": "q8",
"correct": "Christmas is capitalized because it is a holiday, and a song title is capitalized as a proper title.",
"distractor": "Choice D is incorrect because Silent Night is a specific song title, so it should be capitalized as a proper title."
},
{
"item_id": "q9",
"correct": "The first word of a sentence must be capitalized, while common nouns like opening night are not capitalized unless part of a formal title.",
"distractor": "Choice C is incorrect because opening night is not a proper noun here, so it should not be capitalized."
},
{
"item_id": "q10",
"correct": "All the verbs match in past tense (rehearsed, practiced, performed), so the actions stay in the same time frame.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because it mixes present tense (rehearse) with past tense verbs, which breaks consistency."
},
{
"item_id": "q11",
"correct": "You should not place a comma between the subject and its verb, so removing it fixes the sentence.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because the comma separates the subject phrase from the verb was, creating an unnecessary pause."
},
{
"item_id": "q12",
"correct": "An introductory clause should be followed by a comma before the main clause begins.",
"distractor": "Choice D is incorrect because it is missing the comma after the introductory clause."
},
{
"item_id": "q13",
"correct": "Using a comma + but correctly joins two related ideas and clearly shows contrast between them.",
"distractor": "Choice C is incorrect because it creates a run-on by joining two independent clauses without proper punctuation or a conjunction."
},
{
"item_id": "q14",
"correct": "Concise writing removes repeated ideas while keeping the original meaning, which this revision does.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because it repeats the same idea about energy instead of combining it efficiently."
},
{
"item_id": "q15",
"correct": "A semicolon correctly joins two closely related independent clauses, and a transition like afterward can follow it.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because but is a coordinating conjunction, so it should follow a comma, not a semicolon."
},
{
"item_id": "q16",
"correct": "Parallel structure means items in a list use the same grammatical form, and all verbs here are past tense.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because it mixes a base verb (practiced) with a gerund phrase (singing), breaking parallelism."
},
{
"item_id": "q17",
"correct": "A double negative creates an unintended positive meaning, so removing extra negatives makes the meaning clear.",
"distractor": "Choice D is incorrect because it still uses a negative construction that sounds incorrect and unclear in standard English."
},
{
"item_id": "q18",
"correct": "The opener must describe the noun that immediately follows it, and actors are the ones standing backstage.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because it incorrectly suggests the spotlight was standing backstage, which is illogical."
},
{
"item_id": "q19",
"correct": "Although correctly signals contrast between being nervous and still performing confidently.",
"distractor": "Choice B is incorrect because therefore shows cause and effect, not contrast."
},
{
"item_id": "q20",
"correct": "A strong paraphrase keeps the same meaning and logical relationship (crowded auditorium causes tense and exciting moments) using new wording.",
"distractor": "Choice C is incorrect because it changes the cause by blaming the play for being crowded instead of the auditorium."
}
