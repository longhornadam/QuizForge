VALIDATION ERRORS DETECTED
============================================================

The quiz 'Practice 3 Ink in the Rain' has critical errors that must be fixed
before it can be processed. Please fix the following issues:

1. Longest answer is correct in 100% of MC questions (7/7). Balance answer lengths by shortening correct answers or lengthening distractors so the right answer is not obviously the longest.

============================================================
INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVISION
============================================================

Please revise the quiz above to fix all the errors listed.
Make sure:
  - All required fields are present (Type, Prompt, Choices, etc.)
  - MC questions have 2-7 choices with exactly 1 correct answer
  - MA questions have at least 1 correct answer
  - Numerical questions have valid answer/tolerance/range settings
  - All questions have non-empty prompts

Once fixed, save the revised quiz as a new .txt file and
drop it back into the DropZone folder.
