"distractor": "Using certain operators or initializing variables to specific values does not inherently cause infinite loops without additional context."
},
{
"item_id": "q5",
"correct": "These steps follow the proper sequence: initialize variables, write the while statement, indent the body, and ensure the condition can change.",
"distractor": "Writing the while statement before initialization would reference undefined variables."
},
{
"item_id": "q6",
"correct": "The loop executes while count is less than 3, so it runs when count equals 0, 1, and 2, which is three iterations.",

{

},
{
"item_id": "q8",
"correct": "Each time the outer loop iterates, the inner loop runs completely through all of its iterations before returning control to the outer loop.",
"distractor": "The inner loop does not just run once total; it completes its full cycle for every outer loop iteration."
},
{

"correct": "A changeable logical expression and code that updates relevant variables are both necessary to prevent infinite loops.",
"distractor": "Specific variable names, ranges, or statement counts are not requirements for preventing infinite loops."
},
{
"item_id": "q10",
"correct": "Since password is initialized to SECRET, the condition is False immediately, so the loop never runs.",
"distractor": "This code has no mechanism to prompt for input and will not create an infinite loop because the condition starts False."
},
{
"item_id": "q11",
"correct": "Each syntax element serves a specific structural purpose in defining and executing a while loop.",
"distractor": "Confusing the roles of keywords, punctuation, and formatting is common when learning loop syntax."
},
{
"item_id": "q12",
"correct": "Initializing guess to 7 would make the condition False from the start, preventing any loop execution.",
"distractor": "There are no Python restrictions on initialization values, and this specific case would not cause infinite looping."
},
{
"item_id": "q13",
"correct": "All three statements accurately describe how nested loops function, including structure, behavior, and flexibility.",
"distractor": "Nested loops work with any combination of loop types and do not have restrictions on iteration counts."
},
{
"item_id": "q14",
"correct": "The loop starts at 10 and decrements by 1 each iteration, continuing while blastoff is greater than 0, printing 10 down through 1.",
"distractor": "The condition is greater than 0, not greater than or equal to, so 0 itself is not printed."
},
{
"item_id": "q15",
"correct": "The variable x starts at 5 and increments by 1 each time, except when x equals 7 it increments by 3 total (2 plus 1), skipping 8.",
