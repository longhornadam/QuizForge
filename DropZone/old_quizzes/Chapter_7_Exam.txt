---
Type: MC
Points: 5
Prompt:
When testing a program, what are boundary conditions?
Choices:
- [ ] Errors that occur at the start or end of a program

---
Type: MC
Points: 5
Prompt:
A student writes a program to calculate a restaurant bill. The program is supposed to add a 20% tip to the base price. Here is the code:

```python
price = 50.00
tip = price * 0.20
total = price * tip
print("Total bill:", total)
```

What is wrong with this code?
Choices:
- [ ] Syntax error - missing parentheses
- [ ] The tip percentage is incorrect
- [x] Logic error - should add tip to price, not multiply
- [ ] Runtime exception will occur
---
Type: MC
Points: 4
Prompt:
Why is it important to test your program with invalid inputs as well as valid ones?
Choices:
- [ ] Invalid inputs are more common than valid inputs
- [ ] Python requires testing with invalid data
- [x] Real users will eventually enter invalid data, and the program should handle it gracefully
- [ ] Invalid inputs help find syntax errors
---
Type: MA
Points: 5
Prompt:
Which of the following are good practices when adding comments to explain code during troubleshooting? Select all that apply.
Choices:
- [x] Comments can help you understand what code is supposed to do
- [ ] Comments should replace all variable names
- [x] Comments can be important clues about program logic
- [x] Misleading comments can make debugging harder
---

- [ ] -50, -25, 0
- [ ] 25, 50, 75
---
Type: ESSAY
Points: 15
Prompt:
Debug the following program by identifying all errors (there are three: two syntax errors and one logic error). Explain what each error is, what type it is, and how to fix it.

```python
price = 100
taxRate = 0.08
tax = price * taxRate
total = price - tax
discount = 10
if discount > 0
    total = total - discount
print("Final price: $", total
```

Your answer should be 5-8 sentences, addressing each error systematically.

Type: MC
Points: 4
Prompt:
After adding temporary print() statements to debug your code and finding the problem, what should you do with those print() statements?
Choices:
- [ ] Leave them in the code for future reference
- [x] Remove them or comment them out since they're not meant for users
- [ ] Move them all to the beginning of the program
- [ ] Convert them to input() statements
---
Type: MC
Points: 4
Prompt:
When using the Python debugger, what happens if you type 'q' or 'quit' at the (Pdb) prompt?
Choices:
- [ ] The program pauses at the next line
- [ ] The debugger shows you the next 11 lines of code
- [x] The program immediately stops and exits
- [ ] The program continues running at full speed
---
Type: MC
Points: 4
Prompt:
Consider this code that uses nested if statements:

```python
temperature = 75
humidity = 80
if temperature > 70:
    if humidity > 60:
        print("Hot and humid")
    else:
        print("Hot and dry")
else:
    print("Cool")
```

If you wanted to combine these into a single if statement using logical operators, which would be correct?
Choices:
- [ ] if temperature > 70 or humidity > 60:
- [x] if temperature > 70 and humidity > 60:
- [ ] if not (temperature <= 70 and humidity <= 60):
- [ ] if temperature > 70:
---
Type: MC
Points: 4
Prompt:
What is the main advantage of using a debugger over simply adding print() statements throughout your code?
Choices:
- [ ] Debuggers automatically fix all errors
- [ ] Debuggers are faster than print() statements
- [x] Debuggers let you pause execution and inspect variables without modifying your code
- [ ] Print() statements don't work with Python 3
