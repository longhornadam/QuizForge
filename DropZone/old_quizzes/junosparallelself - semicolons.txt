Paragraphs are numbered.\n\n**Suspense Passage (Semicolon Draft With Problems)**\n\n**[1]** At 2:17 a.m., the Borealis Gate sounded like a refrigerator that could not decide whether to breathe or die. Juno sat alone in the control booth under the snowline, watching frost creep across the glass.\n\n**[2]** The monitors showed two live feeds of the same hallway, one from her camera, one from somewhere else. In the second feed the floor tiles were cracked, the exit sign read EAST DOOR, and the clock in the corner counted backward. Juno told herself it was a calibration glitch, she did not believe it.\n\n**[3]** A line of text appeared on her screen: DO NOT TRUST THE NEXT YOU. The message did not have a sender, it did not need one. Juno checked the hallway again, her hallway was empty.\n\n**[4]** The intercom popped with a soft click, then a voice that sounded like her own whispered, \"Open it.\" Juno froze, her hand hovered above the release switch.\n\n**[5]** She could shut the Gate down, she could call for backup, she could run. Instead she reached for the manual; it had never felt heavier. The first page was marked with a note in pencil: If the second door opens you will hear three knocks.\n\n**[6]** Three knocks came immediately; slow, careful, polite. Juno stared at the window and saw movement in the second feed. Someone stood just outside the booth, smiling, wearing her coat.\n\n**[7]** Juno raised her hand; to the glass. The other Juno raised hers too and mouthed a single word: \"Soon.\" The booth lights flickered, and the hallway cameras went dark.\n\n**[8]** On the emergency screen, a message flashed, seal the chamber immediately, do not look into the hallway window. Juno read it once, then twice, and realized the warning was not written for one world."
