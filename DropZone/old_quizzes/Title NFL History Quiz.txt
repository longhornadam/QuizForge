Prompt:
The 1972 Miami Dolphins, led by coach Don Shula, achieved a feat that remains unique in NFL history: the only perfect season. They finished the 14-game regular season undefeated and went on to win all three of their playoff games, culminating in a 14-7 victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII. A key part of their success was overcoming adversity; when starting quarterback Bob Griese was injured in Week 5, 38-year-old backup Earl Morrall stepped in and led the team for the rest of the regular season. The team featured a powerful rushing attack with Larry Csonka and Mercury Morris, and a formidable "No-Name Defense." This historic 17-0 season cemented their legacy as one of the greatest teams of all time.
