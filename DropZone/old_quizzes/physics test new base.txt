Type: STIMULUS
Prompt:
Analyze the system below. A block of mass *m* sits on a rough incline angled at $\theta$. It is connected by a massless string over a frictionless pulley to a hanging mass *M*. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the block and the incline is $\mu_k$.

Type: MC
Prompt:
Evaluate the system's dynamics. If the hanging mass *M* is accelerating downward, which inequality correctly describes the relationship between the gravitational forces and frictional forces acting on mass *m*?
Choices:
- [x] $Mg > mg \sin(\theta) + \mu_k mg \cos(\theta)$
- [ ] $Mg > mg \sin(\theta) - \mu_k mg \cos(\theta)$
- [ ] $Mg < mg \sin(\theta) + \mu_k mg \cos(\theta)$
- [ ] $Mg > \mu_k mg \cos(\theta)$

Type: NUMERICAL
Prompt:
Assume $m = 5.0$ kg, $M = 8.0$ kg, $\theta = 30^\circ$, and $\mu_k = 0.2$. Calculate the acceleration of the system in $m/s^2$. Use $g = 9.8 m/s^2$.
Answer: 4.1
Tolerance: ±0.2

Type: ESSAY
Prompt:
Critique the following hypothesis: "Increasing the angle $\theta$ will always increase the system's acceleration."
Justify your answer by deriving the limit as $\theta \to 90^\circ$ and discussing the competing effects of the gravitational component and the normal force on friction.

===RATIONALES===

Q1: Correct analysis requires identifying that for M to accelerate down, its weight must overcome both the parallel component of m's weight ($mg \sin\theta$) and the opposing friction force ($\mu_k N = \mu_k mg \cos\theta$).
---
Q2: Application of Newton's Second Law: $a = \frac{Mg - mg\sin(30) - \mu_k mg\cos(30)}{M+m}$. Substituting values yields approx 4.1 m/s^2.
---
Q3: The hypothesis is false or conditional. While increasing theta increases the parallel component of gravity (aiding acceleration), it decreases the normal force (reducing friction). However, as theta approaches 90, the setup effectively becomes an Atwood machine, which changes the dynamic entirely.
