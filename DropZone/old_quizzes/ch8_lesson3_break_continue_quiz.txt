Title: Chapter 8, Lesson 3 - Break, Continue, and Else Quiz
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
What does the break statement do when Python executes it inside a loop
Choices:
- [x] Immediately exits the current loop and continues after the loop
- [ ] Skips only the rest of the current iteration
- [ ] Restarts the loop from the top forever
- [ ] Pauses the loop until the user presses Enter
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
What does the continue statement do when Python executes it inside a loop
Choices:
- [ ] Completely exits the loop forever
- [x] Skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next one
- [ ] Restarts the whole program
- [ ] Jumps to the else block after the loop
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
When will an else block that is attached to a loop actually run
Choices:
- [x] Only if the loop finishes all its iterations without hitting a break
- [ ] Only before the first loop iteration
- [ ] Only if the loop body never runs at all
- [ ] Only if the loop condition is always true
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
In a for loop that searches for the first letter e in a word why would you use break
Choices:
- [x] To stop looping as soon as the first e is found
- [ ] To skip every letter that is not e but still finish the loop
- [ ] To force the loop to run exactly ten times
- [ ] To restart the loop whenever e is found
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
Consider this code idea from the lesson search for the first e in a word. When is it useful to have an else block after the loop
Choices:
- [x] When you want to print a message only if no e was found in the entire word
- [ ] When you want to run code every time e is found
- [ ] When you want the loop to repeat forever
- [ ] When you want to skip printing the index of e

Type: MC
Prompt:
What is the main difference between break and continue
Choices:
- [x] break exits the whole loop while continue only skips the rest of the current iteration
- [ ] break only skips the rest of the current iteration while continue exits the loop
- [ ] break and continue always do the same thing
- [ ] break can only be used in while loops and continue can only be used in for loops
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
In a while True loop that checks a password when should you use break
Choices:
- [x] When the user finally enters the correct password so you can leave the loop
- [ ] Whenever the user types anything wrong
- [ ] At the very top of the loop before any checks
- [ ] Inside an else block that will never run
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
In the message sending example from the lesson why is continue a good choice when the message is an empty string
Choices:
- [ ] It skips sending an empty message and goes back to ask for the next one
- [x] It skips sending an empty message and goes back to ask for the next one
- [ ] It exits the loop forever
- [ ] It forces the program to crash so the user notices
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
What will happen in a while True loop if there is no break statement and the condition never changes
Choices:
- [x] The loop will run forever unless the program is stopped from the outside
- [ ] The loop will run exactly once
- [ ] The loop will change into a for loop automatically
- [ ] The loop will stop as soon as it prints one line
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
In a nested loop where a for loop is inside another for loop what happens with the inner loop each time the outer loop runs once
Choices:
- [x] The inner loop runs from start to finish for each single iteration of the outer loop
- [ ] The inner loop runs only once for the entire program
- [ ] The inner loop and outer loop always run at the same time
- [ ] The inner loop never runs unless break is used
---
Type: MA
Prompt:
Which situations are good use cases for break inside a loop
Choices:
- [x] Stop searching a list as soon as you find the item you want
- [x] Leave a password loop when the correct password is entered
- [ ] Skip empty strings but keep looping for other values
- [ ] Repeat the same code forever
- [x] Exit a while True loop when a quit command is given
---
Type: MA
Prompt:
Which situations are good use cases for continue inside a loop
Choices:
- [x] Skip over blank input lines and ask the user again
- [ ] End a loop as soon as one item is found
- [x] Skip all even numbers while still looping over the whole range
- [ ] Restart the whole program from the top
- [x] Skip printing test lines that start with a special character
---
Type: ORDERING
Prompt:
Put these steps in a sensible order for a loop that searches for the first e in a word and reports its index if found
Items:
1. Set current_index to 0
2. For each letter in the word
3. If the letter is e print current_index and use break
4. Increase current_index by 1
5. After the loop if no e was found print a message
---
Type: CATEGORIZATION
Prompt:
Decide whether each task is a better fit for break or for continue
Categories:
- Better for break
- Better for continue
Items:
- Leave a loop as soon as a secret code is entered => Better for break
- Skip printing lines that are blank but keep reading the rest => Better for continue
- Quit a game loop when the player chooses exit => Better for break
- Ignore scores that are negative but still process the others => Better for continue
---
Type: FILEUPLOAD
Prompt:
Below is a broken Python program. It is supposed to act like the messenger example from the lesson.

Goal:
- Keep asking the user to enter a message to send.
- If the user types quit the loop should stop and print Program complete.
- If the user types an empty message nothing should be sent and the loop should just ask again.
- Otherwise the program should print Sending and the message.

YOUR TASK:
1. Create a new text file named yourname_fix_messenger.txt.
2. Copy the code below into that file.
3. Fix the logic using break and continue so the program behaves as described.
4. Save the file.
5. Upload your corrected TXT file here.

BROKEN CODE TO FIX:

message = ""

while True:
    message = input("Enter message to send: ")
    if message == "quit":
        print("Program complete")
        # BUG 1: loop never actually stops here

    if message == "":
        # BUG 2: empty messages should be skipped instead of sent
        print("Sending:", message)

    print("Sending:", message)

===RATIONALES===
---
Q1:
The break statement immediately exits the loop it is in and continues execution with the first statement after the loop.
---
Q2:
The continue statement stops the current loop iteration and jumps to the next evaluation of the loop condition without exiting the loop completely.
---
Q3:
A loop else block runs only if the loop finishes all of its iterations without hitting a break statement, which is how Python defines normal completion for the loop.
---
Q4:
Using break in a search loop lets the program stop looping as soon as the target value is found so it does not waste time checking the rest of the data.
---
Q5:
An else block after a search loop is useful for printing a message if the loop never found the target value, which only happens when the loop finishes normally without break.
---
Q6:
break exits the entire loop, while continue only skips the rest of the current iteration and then allows the loop to continue with the next iteration.
---
Q7:
In a password checking loop you use break when the correct password is entered so that you can leave the while True loop and move on with the program.
---
Q8:
In a messenger program continue is used to skip processing for invalid or empty messages while still keeping the loop running for future input.
---
Q9:
A while True loop with no break and no changing condition will run forever, creating an infinite loop unless something outside the program stops it.
---
Q10:
In a nested loop the inner loop runs to completion for each iteration of the outer loop, which means the inner loop restarts for every outer value.
---
Q11:
Breaking out of a loop early is helpful when you only need to run until you reach a certain condition, such as finding an item, entering a correct password, or typing quit in a menu.
---
Q12:
continue is best when you want to skip certain cases but still process the rest of the sequence, such as blank lines, even numbers, or lines marked to be ignored.
---
Q13:
A search loop typically tracks an index, iterates through the characters, checks for a match, breaks when found, updates the index when not found, and reports if no match was ever found.
---
Q14:
Tasks that need to stop the loop early are better for break, while tasks that only skip specific items but keep looping are better for continue.
