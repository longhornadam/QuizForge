    { "item_id": "mc_thermometer", "correct": "The thigh is the last part to reach safe temperature, and avoiding bone prevents false readings since bone conducts heat differently than meat.", "distractor": "Checking only the breast often leads to overcooking the white meat while the thighs remain undercooked at unsafe temperatures." },
    { "item_id": "fitb_resting", "correct": "A 20-30 minute rest period allows muscle fibers to relax and reabsorb juices that would otherwise run out immediately when carved.", "distractor": "Carving immediately after cooking causes rapid juice loss because the heated liquids inside haven't had time to redistribute and stabilize." },
    { "item_id": "essay_troubleshoot", "correct": "Strong responses identify specific problems like dry breast or pale skin and connect preventative techniques such as breast-down roasting or butter basting to the underlying cause.", "distractor": "Weak responses list problems without explaining the mechanism of prevention or suggest techniques that don't address the root cause." },
    { "item_id": "fileupload_recipe", "correct": "A comprehensive timeline accounts for multi-day thawing, day-before prep, accurate cooking calculations, and post-cooking rest to coordinate all elements for on-time serving.", "distractor": "Timelines that start the morning of Thanksgiving ignore the 4-5 day thawing requirement and create unnecessary time pressure." },
    { "item_id": "ma_food_safety", "correct": "Handwashing, sanitizing surfaces, and separating raw from ready-to-eat foods are core principles that prevent cross-contamination of harmful bacteria.", "distractor": "Using the same cutting board transfers pathogens to ready-to-eat foods, and storing raw turkey on top shelves allows drips to contaminate foods below." },
    { "item_id": "mc_carving", "correct": "Removing the legs first provides stable access to the breast and prevents the turkey from rolling during carving.", "distractor": "Starting with breast slicing is more difficult because the legs create instability and the whole carcass can shift unexpectedly." }
