---
===RATIONALES===
---
Q1: The code is missing a colon after the if condition. In Python, if statements must end with a colon to mark the beginning of the code block. This violates Python's syntax rules, so the interpreter will not be able to run the program at all.
---
Q2: Syntax errors are violations of the programming language's rules that prevent the interpreter from understanding the code. When a syntax error exists, Python cannot translate the code into machine instructions, so the program cannot run at all.
---
Q3: Runtime errors occur in code that is syntactically correct but produces incorrect behavior when executed. These errors follow all syntax rules, may produce unexpected results, and are often caused by logic mistakes rather than rule violations.
---
Q4: The variable `grade` is only assigned a value if one of the if/elif conditions is true. If the score is below 70, none of the conditions match, so `grade` is never defined. When the print statement tries to use `grade`, a NameError exception will be raised.
---
Q5: Program tracing involves adding temporary print() statements to display values and execution flow. This helps programmers understand what the code is doing at specific points without using a full debugger.
---
Q6: Code review should start at the beginning (top) of the program and work sequentially downward. This matches how Python executes code and ensures you understand the state of variables at each point.
---
Q7: The `s` (step) command executes the next statement and then pauses the program again in break state. This allows you to watch the program execute one line at a time.
---
Q8: The program runs without syntax or runtime errors, but the output is consistently wrong by a factor of 2. This indicates a logic error in the formula used to calculate the area - perhaps multiplying by an extra 2 or using the wrong operation.
---
Q9: Temporary print() statements are useful for displaying variable values, confirming which code blocks execute, and tracking program flow. However, they should be removed before final deployment, not used as permanent documentation.
---
Q10: Looking at the code, the error is clear: the average calculation uses addition (+) instead of division (/). A quick code review focusing on the mathematical logic would immediately identify this mistake without needing to run the debugger.
---
Q11: Syntax errors violate Python language rules and prevent execution. Runtime errors allow execution but produce incorrect behavior. Logic errors are a type of runtime error caused by flawed reasoning. Overflow errors occur when numbers exceed data type limits.
---
Q12: The `p` command in the debugger is used to print (display) the values of variables. When followed by multiple variable names separated by commas, it shows all their current values at once.
---
Q13: Breakpoints should be set before the section of code you want to examine closely. This allows the program to run normally until that point, then pause so you can step through the suspicious code carefully.
---
Q14: The debugger can be used proactively before errors occur, not just reactively after crashes. It's a tool for understanding program behavior and finding logic errors, even when the code runs without exceptions.
---
Q15: Since the program runs but gives wrong results, it's a logic error in the formula. The most efficient approach is code review to verify the mathematical formula matches the requirement, rather than adding trace statements or using the debugger unnecessarily.
---
Q16: Comprehensive testing requires checking valid inputs, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions (edge cases). Test cases define specific inputs and expected outputs to verify correct program behavior under various scenarios.
---
Q17: The `pdb.set_trace()` statement creates a breakpoint in your code. When execution reaches this line, the program pauses and enters the debugger's break state, allowing you to examine variables and step through code.
---
Q18: The `input()` function returns a string, but the code tries to compare that string directly to the integer 18. Python cannot compare strings to numbers, so a TypeError exception will be raised at runtime.
---
Q19: The program runs without errors but produces incorrect output (gives "B" when it should give "A"). This is a logic error - the grading condition or threshold is likely incorrect.
---
Q20: Comments are part of code review. If a comment says one thing but the code does something different, it creates confusion. Verifying comment accuracy helps ensure the code is understandable and maintainable.
---
Q21: The `l` (list) command displays 11 lines of code centered around your current location. This helps you see the context of where you are in the program during debugging.
---
Q22: Import statements should be placed at the top (beginning) of Python programs, before any other code. This makes the imported functionality available throughout the entire program.
---
Q23: Good testing includes boundary conditions (edges of acceptable ranges), invalid inputs (to check error handling), and real data (to verify behavior with authentic scenarios). Testing only valid inputs misses important edge cases.
---
Q24: The loop should add each number to total using `total = total + num` or `total += num`. Instead, it assigns each number directly to total, replacing the previous value rather than accumulating the sum.
---
Q25: Good practices include setting strategic breakpoints, examining variables with p, removing temporary traces before final testing, and testing boundaries. Bad practices include starting reviews randomly and leaving debug statements as permanent documentation.
---
Q26: The if condition checks if score is LESS THAN 60, but this is when "Fail" should be printed, not "Pass". The comparison operator should be >= (greater than or equal to) instead of < (less than).
---
Q27: Effective code review follows a systematic process: first understand the error, then start at the beginning, verify each statement's correctness, check variable values, and proceed sequentially through the code.
---
Q28: The `c` (continue) command tells the debugger to resume normal execution at full speed. The program will run until it hits another breakpoint or completes.
---
Q29: Print statements used for tracing can display messages indicating which code blocks are executing. This is especially useful for debugging conditional logic to see which branches are taken.
---
Q30: A comprehensive test case includes critical boundary values: freezing point (32°F/0°C), boiling point (212°F/100°C), and negative temperatures. This tests the formula at important reference points and edge cases.
---
Q31: The arrow (->) indicates the next statement to be executed. The debugger has paused BEFORE running this line, so you can examine the current state before the statement executes.
---
