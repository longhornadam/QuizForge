Title: Chapter 8, Lesson 2 - While Loops Quiz
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
What does a while loop use to decide whether to keep running in Python
Choices:
- [ ] The number of lines in the file
- [x] A logical expression that is either true or false
- [ ] The value of a hidden loop counter
- [ ] The number of variables in the program
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
When is the while loop condition checked
Choices:
- [x] Before each time the loop body runs
- [ ] Only once at the start of the program
- [ ] Only after the loop has finished
- [ ] Only when the user types input
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
If the while loop condition is false the first time it is checked what happens
Choices:
- [x] The loop body is skipped and does not run at all
- [ ] The loop runs exactly one time
- [ ] The loop runs forever
- [ ] Python raises a syntax error
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
Which loop is usually better when you do not know in advance how many times you will need to repeat a task
Choices:
- [x] A while loop
- [ ] A for loop over range
- [ ] A for loop over a short list
- [ ] No loop at all
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
In a password check program which condition will keep asking until the user enters the word SECRET
Choices:
- [x] while password != "SECRET":
- [ ] while password == "SECRET":
- [ ] while password:
- [ ] while "SECRET":
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
What is an infinite loop
Choices:
- [x] A loop that never ends unless something outside stops the program
- [ ] A loop that runs exactly ten times
- [ ] A loop that always ends after one time
- [ ] A loop that skips its body every time
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
Which situation is most likely to create an infinite while loop
Choices:
- [x] Forgetting to update a variable used in the loop condition
- [ ] Typing while instead of for
- [ ] Using more than one print statement
- [ ] Using a variable name that is only one letter long
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
In a password loop like below what must happen inside the loop body to avoid an infinite loop

password = input("Enter password: ")
while password != "SECRET":
    # loop body goes here

Choices:
- [x] Read a new value for password each time through the loop
- [ ] Call range to reset the password
- [ ] Multiply password by 2
- [ ] Print password without changing it
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
In this code why is there a risk of an infinite loop

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)

Choices:
- [x] The loop never changes count so the condition stays true
- [ ] The loop only prints and does not input
- [ ] The condition uses <= instead of ==
- [ ] The loop uses an integer instead of a string
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
In a guess my number while loop what is one good reason to initialize guess to a value that is not the correct answer
Choices:
- [x] So the while condition is true at least once and the loop can start
- [ ] So Python will raise a NameError
- [ ] So the computer can sort all guesses
- [ ] So the loop will never stop
---
Type: ORDERING
Prompt:
Place the steps of a typical input validation while loop in a sensible order
Items:
1. Ask the user for input
2. While the input is not valid
3. Show an error message or reminder
4. Ask the user for input again
5. Continue with the rest of the program
---
Type: MA
Prompt:
Which of the following are good uses for a while loop
Choices:
- [x] Keep asking the user for a password until it is correct
- [x] Repeat a menu until the user chooses to quit
- [ ] Loop exactly five times with values 1 through 5
- [x] Check guesses until the secret number is found
- [ ] Sort a list of numbers a single time
---
Type: CATEGORIZATION
Prompt:
Decide whether each example is more naturally handled by a for loop or a while loop
Categories:
- Better for a for loop
- Better for a while loop
Items:
- Loop through every character in a word => Better for a for loop
- Repeat until the user types quit => Better for a while loop
- Add the numbers from 1 to 100 => Better for a for loop
- Ask for a number until it is between 1 and 10 => Better for a while loop
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
What is a nested loop
Choices:
- [x] A loop that is written inside another loop
- [ ] A loop that never runs
- [ ] A loop that always runs exactly once
- [ ] A loop that uses both for and while at the same time
---
Type: FILEUPLOAD
Prompt:
Below is a broken Python program. It is supposed to count down from 5 to 1 and then print Blastoff. It contains two errors related to while loop syntax and infinite loops.

YOUR TASK:
1. Create a new text file named yourname_fix_countdown.txt.
2. Copy the code below into that file.
3. Fix both errors so the program counts down correctly and then stops.
4. Save the file.
5. Upload your corrected TXT file here.

BROKEN CODE TO FIX:

count = 5

while count > 0
    print("Blastoff in", count)
    # BUG: missing update to count here
print("Blastoff!")

===RATIONALES===
---
Q1:
A while loop continues based on a logical expression that is either true or false, not on file length or variable count.
---
Q2:
The while condition is checked before each run of the loop body so Python can decide whether to enter the loop again.
---
Q3:
If the condition is false the first time, Python skips the loop body entirely and moves on.
---
Q4:
A while loop is useful when you do not know how many repetitions you will need ahead of time.
---
Q5:
The condition while password != "SECRET": stays true until the user types SECRET, so the loop keeps asking for input.
---
Q6:
An infinite loop is one whose condition never becomes false, so it never ends unless something outside stops the program.
---
Q7:
If you do not update a variable used in the condition, the condition may never change, which can make the loop run forever.
---
Q8:
To avoid an infinite password loop, the code inside the loop must read a new value into password each time.
---
Q9:
Because count is never changed, the condition count <= 5 stays true forever, so the loop never ends.
---
Q10:
If guess starts as the correct answer, the while condition might be false immediately and the loop body will never run.
---
Q11:
In input validation you first ask for input, then loop while it is not valid, showing a message and asking again before continuing.
---
Q12:
While loops are ideal for repeating actions until a user chooses to stop, such as password checks or menu options, while fixed count loops are better for for loops.
---
Q13:
Iterating over a known finite collection such as characters or a fixed range is better for a for loop, while loops are better when you need to keep going until a condition becomes true.
---
Q14:
A nested loop is simply one loop inside another loop, often used when you need to repeat a process for each item of an outer loop.
