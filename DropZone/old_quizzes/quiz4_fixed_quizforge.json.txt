From sunrise to bedtime, children watched him closely, waiting for proof he had moved. Sprig wished he could explain that observing families quietly and endlessly was harder than it looked.\n\nEach night he recorded notes for Santa, but not about mischief. He wrote about kindness he saw: who helped clean up, who comforted a younger sibling, who offered the last cookie. Sprig discovered families were gentler than they believed, yet he remained stuck in place, unable to interact or rest.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, he left his final note before returning to the North Pole:\n\"I watched. I learned. I am still tired.\"\n```"
