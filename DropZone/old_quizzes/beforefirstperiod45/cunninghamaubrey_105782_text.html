  <h4 data-start="364" data-end="431"><strong>Drama Version: "Before First Period"</strong></h4>
<p data-start="433" data-end="473"><strong data-start="433" data-end="473">Interior: School hallway, early morning. Harry Rington (13) walks along a back hallway.</strong></p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535"><em data-start="475" data-end="535">(Sound: Lockers clanging in the distance. Footsteps echo.)</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong data-start="652" data-end="664">Harry:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><em>(quietly - to self)</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Why does it feel so empty?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(On the way to his locker, he passes a group of friends.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:&nbsp;</strong>Hey, Adam, are we still meeting up at 5:00 today?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: snickering and giggling)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Adam:</strong> (snickering) No, I'm busy with my science project.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (dejected) Oh...John, you still wanted to play basketball on Saturday, right?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>John:</strong> (disgusted) No thanks. Let's go guys!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (desperate) Wait-</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(The group struts away, leaving a trail of disgust and rudeness behind them.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Harry continues to walk towards his locker)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (to self) Why won't anyone talk to me?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Student 1:</strong> (laughing) Talking to yourself Rington? That's a new low, even for you!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Before Harry can react, the student had already walked away.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (thinking) Something feels wrong.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Harry finally made it to his first class, after putting his bag in his locker and looting the vending machine for snacks.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: quiet chatter of students, echo of footsteps, and the ringing bell.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (smiling) Hi Coach Rassberri!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri</strong><strong>:</strong> (blank face) Hello Harry. Please go take your seat.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (thinking) That's a bit...harsh for Coach Rassberri...is she alright?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (normal expression) Are you alright Coach Rassberri?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri:</strong> (sternly) Please. Take. Your. Seat.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Harry finally takes his seat, although he can't stop thinking about how Coach's movements, tone, and face seemed...wrong)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri:</strong> (smiling) Class is now dismissed. Please exit the room.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Harry stumbles out of his seat, eager to leave)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: Steps echo throughout the hallway, kids chatter, and lockers slam shut)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (thoughts) Everyone seems unbothered, so I should do what I normally do.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Harry started walking towards the reading hallway for his next class. He even forgot about the incident for a minute.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri:</strong> (smiling) Hello, Harry. Having fun?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (frowning) Didn't I just see you outside of your classroom?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri:</strong> (no expression) Please go take your seat.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Just then an announcement played over the loudspeaker.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Loudspeaker:</strong> (yelling) CODE RED, CODE RED!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (thoughts) Code Red means we need to evacuate!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Loudspeaker:</strong> (yelling) THEY GOT IN! EVERYBODY HIDE!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(For a moment, everybody was silent. Then it happened.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: Kids screaming and loud footsteps)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (confused) What's going on?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri:</strong> (smiling) Please, come in and take your seat.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (scared) We're supposed to evacuate though!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri:</strong> (angry) *grabs his arm* You must take your seat.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> *pulls his hand away* What's wrong with you?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: Teachers leading scared students to places to hide)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (thoughts) She's...one of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Darkness begins to close in on them)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Harry:</strong> (realization) Something's very wrong here.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Harry sprints down the seemingly endless hall, and tries to open every door he sees.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: Door knobs rattling and one pair of footsteps echoing down the long hall)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri:</strong> (smiling) You can't run from us anymore.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Harry didn't try to run; there was nothing he could do since he'd reached the end of the hallway.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Coach Rassberri:</strong> I've finally caught up.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>(CUT TO BLACK)</strong></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>THE END</strong></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">&nbsp;</p>
