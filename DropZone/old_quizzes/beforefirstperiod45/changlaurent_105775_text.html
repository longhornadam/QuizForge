<p>Charlie(student)</p>
<p>Mrs. Crawn (teacher)</p>
<p>Jack : Charlie’s friend</p>
<p>(Charlie walks down the school hallway earlier than usual)</p>
<p>(Sound: Sharp noises more amplified than usual)</p>
<p>Charlie: (stops) How are you guys doing?</p>
<p>Students: Great!</p>
<p>(Charlie takes a few steps before he stops to a halt seeing Mrs. Crawn)</p>
<p>Charlie: Hi Mrs. Crawn! How’s your day?</p>
<p>Mrs. Crawn: Good.</p>
<p>No expression just pure words</p>
<p>(Charlie walks more before he sees… Mrs. Crawn again????)</p>
<p>Charlie: H- Hi? I thought you were just down there?</p>
<p>Mrs. Crawn: Great.</p>
<p>No expression just pure words</p>
<p>Charlie: I am terrified of what’s happening. For whatever reason I can’t-</p>
<p>Mrs. Crawn: Charlie come here, Charlie come here.</p>
<p>(Charlie walks to Mrs. Crawn looking at her)</p>
<p>Charlie: Yes?</p>
<p>(Mrs. Crawn was never there)</p>
<p>(Now, with terror in mind about his reality, does she know it’s really his world?)</p>
<p>Charlie: (stops walking) Why are they acting so…, odd?</p>
<p>(Charlie heads to class feeling uneasy)</p>
<p>(As Charlie gets the courage to walk into the classroom, she sees…)</p>
<p>Mrs. Crawn: Hello there Charlie. (Her face filled with joy)</p>
<p>Charlie: H- Hi Mrs. Crawn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Crawn: (points to a desk in the middle of the class) That’ll be your seat next to Jack.</p>
<p>Charlie heads to his seat putting his backpack behind his chair.</p>
<p>Charlie: Let's do this.</p>
