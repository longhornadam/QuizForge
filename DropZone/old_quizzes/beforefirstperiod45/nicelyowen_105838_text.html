<h1>Before First Period (Adaptation - Major): Owen Nicely</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>MARCO-13,&nbsp; TYLER-12,&nbsp;&nbsp; ANDREW-13,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALEX-12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INTERIOR- A hallway with the walls lined with lockers and rooms. Kids are chatting with their friends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marco arrived at school earlier than usual, wanting to make sure he had time to study before his big test. The building looked exactly like it always did, yellow paint that was chipping off the walls, the tiles on the ceiling turning a brownish color from the leaking roof, and the fluorescent light that shone too bright for a Monday morning. The only difference was the air felt somehow heavier than usual. As Marco walked down the hallway, he saw his teacher, Mr. Richardson, standing outside his classroom. But he was standing too still, and smiling too wide. Marco walked up to him and Mr. Richardson greeted him as usual but almost sounded like he was someone reading from a paper but didn’t actually know what the words meant.</p>
<p>Mr. Richardson 60s :(standing still smiling wide) Hello Marco.</p>
<p>Marco: (Walking past him quickly to the cafeteria) He-Hello Mr. Richardson.</p>
<p>Marco walked past him muttering to him self</p>
<p>Marco: (sounding concerned) Somethings off…</p>
<p>Marco passed a small group of other students named Tyler, Andrew, and Alex and spoke to them.</p>
<p>Marco: (excitedly) Hey yall!</p>
<p>Tyler: (Sounding bored, almost annoyed) Oh, hey.</p>
<p>Anderew: (Sounding like he didn’t sleep last night) Hey.</p>
<p>Marco: Are yall doing anything later? I don’t have any homework so after school im free!</p>
<p>Alex: Uh actually we all have a class to get to so uh, bye!</p>
<p>(They all hurriedly walk to the gym like there’s a prize waiting for them</p>
<p>Marco thought they were being weird because they always are so nice but it seemed like they didn’t want to talk or even be around him. That’s when he saw his 5<sup>th</sup> period teacher, Mrs. Taylor. She was just staring at him, without blinking and with a wide smile.</p>
<p>Mrs. Taylor: (grinning and talking the same as Mr. Richardson) Hello, Marco.</p>
<p>Marco gave a quick wave before the speakers crackled to life and Mr. Smiths came over the intercom</p>
<p>Mr. Smith: (With the same eerie tone the other teachers) Good morning. Please look at your nearest teacher in the eyes and follow them to the gym, we have a gift for everyone who is in the school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marco didn’t look at a teacher because he felt something was off, he had only looked at their mouths because the way they were moving didn’t match the sounds that were coming out. Instead he looked toward the gym and saw kids following teachers as if they were zombies with no free will.</p>
