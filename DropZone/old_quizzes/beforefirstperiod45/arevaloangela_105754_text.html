<p data-start="433" data-end="473"><strong data-start="433" data-end="473">Interior: School hallway, early in the morning. Gina (14) walks down a cold, empty hallway, gripping the straps of her backpack tightly, gritting her teeth behind her lips.</strong></p>
<p data-start="433" data-end="473"><em data-start="475" data-end="535">(Sound: Lights flickering, footsteps and far-away sounds of lockers closing)</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong data-start="652" data-end="664">Gina:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><em>(muttering to self) Why is it so... quiet?...</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>Gina looks around, her eyes tracing for anyone in the empty hallway.</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: student chatter and footsteps coming closer to Gina)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Gina:&nbsp;</strong>(joyed to see the group) Oh hey guys! How was y'all's morning?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: group of girls continue to chatter, one girl responds to Gina)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Girl:</strong> (Bluntly, not fully paying attention) oh hey, yea good morning.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>The groups of girls pass Gina, leaving her behind with a brief response and alone. It seems as if they didn't care to talk to her, rather rushed.</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: The group of girls passing down the hallway, their footsteps getting quicker and more faint.)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>Gina looks behind her, watching the girls turn a corner and disappear from her sight, continuing her path down the hallway.</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: Footsteps, seemingly one person)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>A teacher, Mr. Colt(34), comes around the corner, smiling ear to ear.</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Gina:</strong> Good morning Mr. Colt! Had your morning coffee yet?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>Gina teased, expecting a teasing answer back, but Mr. Colt didn't look at her, still smiling</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Mr. Colt:</strong> (cheerful) Good Morning!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>Mr. Colt walked past and turned a corner behind her, just like the group of girls.</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Gina:</strong> (confusion) Wha- Mr. Colt? Where are you going?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>Gina tries to go follow Mr. Colt, but when she turned around to follow, a familiar voice came behind her.</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Mr. Colt: </strong>(cheerful) Good Morning!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Gina:&nbsp;</strong>Wait- but you just passed me and- hold on! You just said the exact same thing!</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">Mr. Colt didn't say anything, but just pass her again, following the same path as the rest.</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>Gina's heart pounds in her chest, not knowing what's happening to her.</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Gina:</strong> (fear in her voice, shaky) what's happening...? Why was there two Mr. Colt...s?</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: sudden loud alarm, the announcements turn on with the three dings.</p>

<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>The announcements loop a couple times before turning off. Gina was basically sweating in fear, her breathing was harsh.</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Gina:</strong> (Shaky and scared) Double what-..? Hide?... Oh no...</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: Gina's ears ringing from the fear and the loud alarm in the background...)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><em>All Gina can think of was what was going to happen to her... Was she going to live? Was she going to die? What's happening to Mr. Colt?</em></p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696">(Sound: Slow, wet footsteps. low growling behind Gina)</p>
<p data-start="652" data-end="696"><strong>Mr. Colt(...?):</strong> Good morning, Gina.</p>
