  <p>Before First Period</p>
<p>Interior: A Middle School, 7:45 A.M.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Sounds of footsteps, chattering and laughing echoed sharply into MARIA 's (13) ears although it was quiet. A heavy quiet, like if someone died. She walks towards the gym, encountering a teacher in a beige suit and black hair tied in a ponytail.</em></p>
<p><em>MARIA:</em> (Smiling) Good Morning.</p>
<p><em>TEACHER 1:&nbsp;</em>(Relays the smile a bit too wide with a robotic tone) Good morning.</p>
<p><em>MARIA's smile faded for a moment and her brow twitched but she shook her head and continued on, encountering a group of students.</em></p>
<p><em>MARIA:</em> Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>STUDENT 1:</em> (Similar robotic tone) Hi.</p>
<p><em>STUDENT 2: </em>(Waves)</p>
<p><em>MARIA:&nbsp;</em>Hmm... Do you guys like... Pokemon?</p>
<p><em>STUDENT 1:&nbsp;</em>(Unblinking) Maybe.</p>
<p><em>The group of students shuffle away without a second glance.</em></p>
<p><em>Maria, confused and butthurt, continued walking to gym class.</em></p>
<p><em>MARIA: </em>(Glancing down at a squished bug) Oh! Poor spider... Looks kinda weird. (Takes out phone and takes a picture) Cool.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>MARIA encounters another teacher along the way. The spanish teacher. They look the same as the first teacher... Shrugging away the similarities, MARIA greets the spanish teacher.</em></p>
<p><em>MARIA: Hola senor!</em></p>
<p><em>TEACHER 2: (Staring at the spot she standing in a few seconds ago)&nbsp;</em>Hello Maria.</p>
<p><em>MARIA: </em>(Awkwardly backs up to where he was staring) I should go... I don't want to be late!... Heh...</p>
<p><em>Maria wonders what the hell was happening as she speedily walked through the hallways with her head down.</em></p>
<p><em>MARIA:&nbsp;</em>(Quietly to self) That can't be a coincidence...</p>
<p><em>Maria was cut off by an announcement.</em></p>
<p><em>SCHOOL INTERCOM:&nbsp;<strong>LOCKDOWN, LOCKDOWN. SHUT OFF ALL LIGHTS AND LOCK THE DOORS.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Silence. Stillness. Suddenly all together kids all around Maria robotically moved into classrooms, herded by their even more robotic teachers and doors were shutting all around her.</em></p>
<p><em>MARIA: </em>(Urgent and panicked) No! No! Wait for me!&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>MARIA: </em>Uh oh-...</p>
<p><em>Fades to black.</em></p>
