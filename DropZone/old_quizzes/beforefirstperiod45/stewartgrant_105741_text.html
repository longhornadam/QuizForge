<p>Jerald: (walking into the cafeteria from getting dropped off)</p>
<p>Jerald: (see that the whole school is already there but its dead silent)</p>
<p>Marco: (waves at Jerald from the cafe motioning him to come over)</p>
<p>Jerald: (walks over sits down and whispers) Why is everyone so quiet</p>
<p>Marco: (rushed) I'll tell you later</p>
<p>Jerald: What why</p>
<p>Marco: (already walking away) We're about to leave</p>
<p>(Jerald and Marco both get up and walk down the hallway to their 1st period classes)</p>
<p>Jerald: (talking to himself) Why was Marco rushing something isn't right</p>
<p>(Jerald stops at a water fountain to get water)</p>
<p>(Jerald looks up after drinking and sees that Marco is gone)</p>
<p>(Then walks to a group of older boys in the hall that were whispering like they were scared of anyone else hearing)</p>
<p>(Jerald slowly walks over and the group becomes quiet)</p>
<p>Jerald: Why is everyone quiet and scared to talk</p>
<p>(Theodore the tallest boy in the group walks towards Jerald)</p>
<p>Theodore: (bends down and whispers in Jerald's ear) It's because of something strange going on\</p>
<p>Jerald: (looking frustrated yells) What's going on</p>
<p>(Theodore runs back to the group and they all start running around the corner)</p>
<p>(10 seconds after the group runs around the corner a tall slender man (30s) walks around it)</p>
<p>Jerald: (looks up) Who are you</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson: My name is Mr. Johnson I'm the new math teacher</p>
<p>Jerald: Nice to meet you</p>
<p>(Jerald continues walking to the end of the hallway the same tall slender man walks around another corner)</p>
<p>Jerald: (asking questioningly) who are you</p>
<p>Mr. Laquitioa: I'm Mr. Laquitioa</p>
<p>Jerald: I could have sworn I---</p>
<p>Announcement: Everyone find somewhere safe to hide things might become dangerous</p>
