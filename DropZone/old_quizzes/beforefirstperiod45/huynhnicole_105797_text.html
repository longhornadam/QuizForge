  <p>Drama version</p>
<p>Interior: School hallway, early morning. Marcia (15) walks through the hallways.</p>
<p>(Sound: Distant sounds of chatting and locker slams.)</p>
<p>Marcia: (to self) Why is it so quiet today? Oh, there is a group over there. I should ask them.</p>
<p>(Marcia walks up to a group of students talking)</p>
<p>Marcia: Why is it so quiet? Is anything going on today?</p>
<p>(George (14) stops chatting and looks over to Marcia)</p>
<p>George: (looks at their wrist) Gotta go, guys come on!</p>
<p>Marcia: Wait! Wait, can you answer my question? Please.</p>
<p>George: (looks over at Marcia) Sorry, I have to go.</p>
<p>(The rest of the group follows George)</p>
<p>Marcia: (to self) That was weird. Oh There’s Mrs. Smith. Hi Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Smith moves her head in an inhuman manner)</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith: (cheerly) Oh hi, Marcia.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Smith acts strange. She acts very happy to the point, it's inhuman)</p>
<p>Marcia: (suspicious) I’ll… be going now. Hope you have a good day!</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith: See you later.</p>
<p>(Marcia speedwalks away.)</p>
<p>Marcia: (looks around – to self) Something is wrong. Something is definitely wrong. Mrs. Smith would definitely talk more. It’ll be fine. It’ll be fine.</p>
<p>(Marcia sees someone that looks exactly like Mrs. Smith in the distance)</p>
<p>(Sound: Chatting starts to quiet down as a teacher’s yelling is heard.)</p>
<p>Marcia: (runs up to her) Wait, you look exactly like Mrs. Smith?</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith: Oh hi, Marcia.</p>
<p>Marcia: Mrs. Smith, weren't you over there-</p>
<p>School Announcement: Watch out for skinwalkers! Don’t trust anyone nearby. Be safe, students and teachers.</p>
<p>(Sound: The sound of students chatting and locker slamming disappears instantly.)</p>
<p>Marcia looks around, and there were no one but her and Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>Marcia: (shocked) Y-you aren’t Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>Not Mrs. Smith: (smiles) Oh hi, Marcia.</p>
<p>(Not Mrs. Smith changes and Marcia shrieks)</p>
<p>THE END</p>
