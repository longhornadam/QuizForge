<h1>Before First Period (Adaptation - Major): Dylan Berkenpas</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p><strong>Interior: School hallway, before first period. Bob (13) walking to his first period class</strong></p>
<p><em>(sound: lockers closing, people talking, shoes squeaking)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong><em>(quietly to self)&nbsp;</em>why does it feel so empty today?</p>
<p><em>Bob is walking to his first class when he spots&nbsp; </em><strong>Billy (13) Ben (14)&nbsp;</strong><em>and&nbsp;</em><strong>Bart (13)</strong></p>
<p><em>(Sounds: Billy talking to Ben and Bart)</em></p>
<p><strong>Billy</strong>: I know right and then...</p>
<p><em>Billy spots Bob looking at him and starts talking to him</em></p>
<p><strong>Billy:&nbsp;</strong>hey, nice shirt</p>
<p><strong>Ben:&nbsp;</strong>yeah sick shirt</p>
<p><strong>Bart:</strong> cool shirt</p>
<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong>Thanks, it was an early christma...</p>
<p><em>Billy, Ben, and Bart all walk away in the middle of Bob speaking</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob: (</strong><em>shocked)&nbsp;</em>Did they just leave in the middle of my conversation?</p>
<p><strong>Bob: (</strong><em>walking away) </em>What is going on today?</p>
<p><em>Bob turned the corner and spotted his old teacher from last year</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> (<em>Walking)</em> I should go talk to my old teacher maybe he will brighten my mood</p>
<p><em>Bob decides to talk to his old teacher Mr. Simon (</em><strong>30s</strong><em>)</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hello Mr. Simon long time no see</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Simon: </strong><em>(</em><em>Without blinking)&nbsp;</em>Hey Bob... great to see you again</p>
<p><strong>Bob:&nbsp;</strong>yeah... I'll see you later (<em>w</em><em>alking away slowly)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Simon</strong> (<em>Without blinking)</em> you bet...</p>
<p><em> Bob kept walking down the hall feeling really anxious and tried to calm himself down by using a method his grandma taught him</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> (<em>In his head)</em> 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9...<em></em></p>
<p><em>this method worked and Bob felt like everything went back to normal</em></p>
<p><em>Bob kept walking down the hall, but he Mr. SImon again</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob: (</strong><em>confused)&nbsp;</em>Wait? wasn't he just down the other hallway?</p>
<p><em>Bob decided to go closer and talk to him</em></p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Hey, long time no see</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Simon:</strong><em> (wIthout blinking)&nbsp;</em>Hey Bob... great to see you again</p>
<p><strong>Bob: </strong>But you just said that</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Simon</strong> (<em>without blinking)</em> You bet...</p>
<p><em>This time Bob didn't just walk way he ran away to the next hallway</em></p>
<p><em>Then the loud speaker chimed in and told everyone to not panic and hide</em></p>
<p><em>When the loudspeaker ended, the hall was really silent and the halls were empty.</em><em></em></p>
<p><strong>Bob: (</strong><em>talking to himself) </em>something is very wrong&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>END&nbsp;</strong></p>
