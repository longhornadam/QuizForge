<p><strong>Before first period adaptation</strong></p>
<p>(Setting: at school entrance doors)</p>
<p>Carl: Man, I’m early today.</p>
<p>(Enters school)</p>
<p>Carl: Why is it so quiet today…</p>
<p>(He sees his friends)</p>
<p>Carl: Hey guys!</p>
<p>(They talk, but the interaction feels rushed, as if they had to get somewhere…)</p>
<p>(Carls tries to continue the conversation)</p>
<p>Carl: Hey guys, what do you want to do later?</p>
<p>(They keep walking away with little to no reaction.)</p>
<p>Carl: (In head) <em>Why does everything feel off today…</em></p>
<p>(Carl approaches the teacher monitoring the entrance, he greets him)</p>
<p>Carl: Good morning Mr. Simmons!</p>
<p>Mr. Simmons: Good morning, Carl.</p>
<p>(His expression had no change; his tone and movement were unusual.)</p>
<p>Carl: (In head) <em>What’s up with him?</em></p>
<p>Carl: (In head) <em>Maybe if I just go on with my day I’ll calm down.</em></p>
<p>(Spots another adult down the hall)</p>
<p>Carl: Good morning again Mr. Simmons! <strong><em>(Wasn’t he just back there…)</em></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Simmons: Good morning, Carl.</p>
<p>Carl: (In head) <em>The same bland response…</em></p>
<p>Loudspeaker: (Calm but serious tone) If you feel something behind you, do not look back, do not run away, stay still and close your eyes. Do not run away if you look back, it has started. (<em>Speaker crackles, ends</em>)</p>
<p>(The hallway was uncomfortably silent)</p>
<p>Carl: What is going on? Hello?</p>
<p>(The adults start acting as one)</p>
<p>(The students in front of Carl are being guided behind him)</p>
<p>Carl: Where are you guys going!</p>
