<h1>Before First Period (Adaptation - Major): Avery Truong</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>Before first period</p>
<p>Interior: Berkley High school hallway, 6:45 in the morning, Sadie (18) walking down from tutoring to go to the gym.</p>
<p>(Sound: Heavy footsteps echoing though the senior hallways while the kids walk by silently)</p>
<p>Sadie: (to herself) It feels empty even though I see like 100 different people.</p>
<p>(tiny bunches of kids speaking very loudly)</p>
<p>(Sadie sees her friends and goes up to them)</p>
<p>Sadie: Hiiiiii are we still on for basketball tomorrow, Hally?</p>
<p>Hally: no sorry, got homework</p>
<p>(Halley and rest of group start giggling)</p>
<p>(Sadie walks away in humiliation)</p>
<p>Sadie: (says to herself) what do you mean you have homework we have all the same classes, and we haven’t even started the day.</p>
<p>(female teacher comes from the music room)</p>
<p>Sadie: Hi, Mrs. Willow &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Willow: (In a high-pitched voice with a straight face) Hallow Sadie.</p>
<p>(a cold breeze hits Sadie)</p>
<p>Sadie: (to herself) That was weird, Mrs. Willow usually has a very deep voice, it is probably just a voice crack.</p>
<p>(Sadie is halfway to the gym Coach A is standing and for a split-second when Coach A turns around Sadie sees Mrs. Willow)</p>
<p>(Anyways, she goes up to Coach A)</p>
<p>Sadie: Hii Coach A, when are basketball tryouts?</p>
<p>Coach A: (With a straight face and a high-pitched voice) Hello Sadie, and it’s September 13.</p>
<p>(Sadie walking past coach in a nervous strut as she speeds up)</p>
<p>Sadie: that got to be a coincidence….</p>
<p>(7:00 announcements come on)</p>
<p>(random screech coming from the speaker)</p>
<p>Hally: (In a soft voice) Everyone please make sure to have your plant supplies on…….</p>
<p>(announcements cut off briefly)</p>
<p>(kids running to the nearest exit very silently)</p>
<p>Sadie: (in her mind as she is sprinting to exit 66B) plant is our school’s safe word, but what else was she going to say? (in a worried panic)</p>
<p>(Sadie watching as all the adults surround the kids and guide them away into the gym)</p>
