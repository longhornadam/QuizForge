  <p><strong>TITLE: </strong>Before First Period</p>
<p><strong>CHARACTERS:</strong></p>
<p>AMELIA (15)</p>
<p>&nbsp;HAZEL (15)</p>
<p>ALICIA (16)</p>
<p>MEGAN (15)</p>
<p>MS. SMITH (40)</p>
<p>MR. JOHNSON (45)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER</p>
<p>(INTERIOR<em>:&nbsp;School hallway, early in the morning around 7 AM, bleak, light blues and grays, beige lockers lining the walls, small groups of 3 to 4 students scattered around the hallway)</em></p>
<p>(SOUND: <em>Students talking in hushed voices, shoes squeaking against the floor, sounds echo very sharply before fading away)</em></p>
<p>(AMELIA walks into the hallway, stops, and looks around before shivering)</p>
<p>(AMELIA starts walking again, coming to a stop before a group of students: HAZEL, ALICIA, and MEGAN)</p>
<p>AMELIA: Hi guys!</p>
<p>HAZEL: Hi. You’re here a lot earlier than usual.</p>
<p>(The rest of the group murmurs in agreement)</p>
<p>ALICIA: Yeah, I am surprised. You are usually super late.</p>
<p>AMELIA: Yeah, I woke up before my alarm and decided to just get up and come to school.</p>
<p>(The group is silent for a few seconds before MEGAN starts looking over her shoulder, as if looking for someone to walk up to her. She seems nervous.)</p>
<p>AMELIA: (speaking to MEGAN now) You good?</p>
<p>MEGAN: (rushing her words) Yeah, I’m fine.</p>
<p>(The group is silent once more before MEGAN starts tapping her foot impatiently)</p>
<p>MEGAN: Uh, I better get going. Got to go to class.</p>
<p>(MEGAN starts hurriedly walking away)</p>
<p>ALICIA: Yeah, I have to go too.</p>
<p>HAZEL: Same over here.</p>
<p>(They both walk off before AMELIA can say anything)</p>
<p>AMELIA: (talking to herself) Class? What class at this time?</p>
<p>(AMELIA runs to catch up with HAZEL, the closest one to her)</p>
<p>AMELIA: Wait, what class are you going to?</p>
<p>(HAZEL ignores her, almost as if she can’t hear anything. Her face looks unconcerned, but her breath is very shallow and slow.)</p>
<p>AMELIA: Hello? (pause) Hazel? (another longer pause) What class are you going to?</p>
<p>(HAZEL ignores her once more)</p>
<p>(AMELIA stops walking, a concerned look on her face, before continuing in a different direction towards her first period. Right as she turns a corner to go down a different hallway, she sees her first period teacher.)</p>
<p>AMELIA: Hi Ms. Smith!</p>
<p>(MS. SMITH stops abruptly. She is wearing an all black ensemble covering the top of her neck down to her feet.)</p>
<p>MS. SMITH: (in a flat, monotone like a robot would have) Hi Amelia.</p>
<p>AMELIA: How are you ?</p>
<p>MS. SMITH: I am fine, thank you very much. How have you-</p>
<p>(MS. SMITH stops talking and abruptly turns and walks away, her flat, unconcerned expression never leaving her face)</p>
<p>AMELIA: (mumbling to herself) Well, that was weird.</p>
<p>(AMELIA looks behind her to where MS. SMITH walked away. She is nowhere to be seen. AMELIA continues walking in the direction she was originally going, toward her first period class.)</p>
<p>AMELIA: (nervously) What is wrong with everyone today?</p>
<p>(After a few steps AMELIA relaxes, finding her rhythm walking to class. Everything and everybody look normal and unconcerning)</p>
<p>(As AMELIA walks further down the hall, she encounters another teacher, MR. JOHNSON)</p>
<p>AMELIA: Hi Mr. Johnson!</p>
<p>MR. JOHNSON: (in a flat monotone) Hi Amelia.</p>
<p>(AMELIA notices that MR. JOHNSON is wearing the same all black attire as MS. SMITH.)</p>
<p>AMELIA: Oh! Are all the teachers matching in all black today?</p>
<p>MR. JOHNSON: I am fine, thank you very much. How have you-</p>
<p>(MR. JOHNSON stops talking and abruptly turns and walks away, his flat, unconcerned expression never leaving his face)</p>
<p>AMELIA: (concerned) What? Why did he-</p>
<p>(An announcement is made over the speakers, cutting AMELIA off.)</p>
<p>ANNOUNCER: Attention all students, please make your way into the nearest classroom. This is for your safety.</p>
<p>(There is static for a few seconds before nothing. The hall drops eerily silent.)</p>
<p>AMELIA: Wait, what? For our safety? What does that mean?</p>
<p>(AMELIA turns around. Students walk slowly together like robots, being ushered out by the teachers, all students and teachers were making no sound, not even breathing. All the teachers were wearing the same black ensemble.)</p>
<p>(MS. SMITH walks up behind AMELIA, gently tapping her on the shoulder. She is no longer wearing the black ensemble; instead, a deep red velvet cloak over dark clothes)</p>
<p>MS. SMITH: You aren’t supposed to be here.</p>
<p>(MS. SMITH grabs AMELIA. AMELIA starts screaming before falling limp.)</p>
<p>(CUT TO BLACK)</p>
