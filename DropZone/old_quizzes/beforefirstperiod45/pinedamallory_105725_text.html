<h1>Before First Period (Adaptation - Major): Mallory Pineda</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>Interior: School hallway leading to classrooms. Mason (15) walking down the hallway to his first class of the day. A group of teenagers talk on the side of the hallway.</p>
<p>(Sound: Quiet, rushed, whispering from the group) their gaze followed Mason as soon as he turned his back.</p>
<p>(Mason notices the tones of words are sharper and louder than usual)</p>
<p>(Mason passed by one of his teachers in the hallway, Mrs. Williams (40s), she was standing outside her door with a blank stare on her face)</p>
<p>Mason: (smiling) Good Morning, Mrs. Williams.</p>
<p>(He expected the same warm excited tone as usual, but she sounded different. Stranger than normal, almost a robotic switch was controlling her)</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams: (low, monotone) Good Morning, Mason.</p>
<p>(Mason felt uneased at the sound of it)</p>
<p>Sound: shoes squeaking to class, low talking in background)</p>
<p>(Mason passes by another teacher, Mr. Rick (mid 20s), he looks the same as Mrs. Williams, standing outside his door with a blank stare on his face.)</p>
<p>Mason: (trying to forget what just happened) Good morning, Mr. Rick. Feeling good or feeling amazing!</p>
<p>(Mr. Rick didn’t even look down to acknowledge him, he continued to stare blankly)</p>
<p>Mr. Rick: (low, monotone, voice) Good morning, Mason.</p>
<p>(He sounds the exact same way as Mrs. Williams, too)</p>
<p>(Mason is sure something is wrong; he nearly gets a word out when he is interrupted)</p>
<p>Mason: (confused) What is going on tod---.</p>
<p>(sound: screechy announcement static, kids stop to listen)</p>
<p>(Announcements start, Mr. Chide (late 50s) is speaking)</p>
<p>Mr. Chide: (Low hurried voice) Remember dolphins, always have some form of protection on you, whether it’s scissors, a pencil, or a Stanley stay safe in case of any dangerous activity in the school. And remember if you see something, say something. Stay safe children. (Ending static begins)</p>
<p>(Sound: Static from the speakers ends, the hallway is silent, students stop and look at each other, not in confusion but in understanding and determination.)</p>
<p>(Mason is confused and a little scared. He tries to look for a teacher to talk to about this weird announcement, but everyone is either gone or rushed into classrooms by an administrator.)</p>
<p>Mason: (Shakey, scared, voice) Somethings wrong. What’s going on here!?</p>
<p>(Mason now realizes that the teachers are no longer their own individuals, but something else, they are one.)</p>
