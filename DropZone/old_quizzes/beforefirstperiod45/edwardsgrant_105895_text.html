<p data-start="433" data-end="473"><strong data-start="433" data-end="473">Interior: School hallway, early morning. Marcia (14) walks along a back hallway with her books clutched in her arms protectively.</strong></p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535"><em data-start="475" data-end="535">(Sound: Lockers clanging in the distance. Footsteps echo,)</em></p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535"><em>Justin: (quietly - to self)</em><span>&nbsp;</span>Why does it feel so empty?</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Justin, walking down the hallway.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Justin: Hey, what are you doing John? Why does it feel so empty?</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">John: (no expression) I don't know know. It doesn't feel empty to me.</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(John walks away at a fast pace, making the interaction feel rushed.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Justin: What's going on with everybody?</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Sound: The hallway noise fades.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(A few moments later, Justin has his first interaction with his teacher.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Justin: (walking into class) Hi Mrs. Johnson, how is your day going?</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Mrs. Johnson: (no expression) I'm okay.</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Justin: Is everything okay?</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Mrs. Johnson: Everything's fine.</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(The conversation ended abruptly, with no real resolution)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(JUSTIN had noticed that both John and Mrs. Johnson has almost the exact same body movements, and they both had the same blank facial expression.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Justin: Something has happened to this school and everybody in it, I just don't know what.</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Sound: (Distant footsteps echoing)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Justin was heading to his second period class when he encountered another adult that looked almost exactly identical with the first teacher.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Justin: I just - I just... I just say you down at the other side of the hallway.</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Sophia: I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Sophia suddenly walked away without saying another word.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Justin finally gets to his second period class with Mr. James)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Mr. James: Okay class, let's open up to page forty seven of our notebooks.</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Mr. James seemed to be the only normal person Justin met today)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Sound: Pages shuffling, Pencils clattering.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(As Mr.James was talking, a school announcement came on.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Announcement: Everybody must stay in the building until told to leave)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Justin: What's going on? Am I going crazy?</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(Sound: Complete silence. Everybody's sitting perfectly still.)</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">Mr. James: Come with me Justin. I've been waiting for this for a long time.</p>
<p data-start="475" data-end="535">(What JUSTIN didn't know was that nobody was acting as their own individuals anymore, but as being guided away.)</p>
