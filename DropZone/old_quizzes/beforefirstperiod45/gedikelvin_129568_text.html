<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT SPEAKER</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;UNKNOWN FIGURE </strong><em>(&nbsp; ?&nbsp;&nbsp; )</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>INTERIOR</strong><em>:</em> <strong>EMMA </strong><em>walks around</em><strong> </strong><em>Emerson High's hallways at a slow tempo. Her heavy backpack slows her down, forcing her to walk slow</em></p>
<p><em>She never heard of her school so quiet before. Echoes bounced off the stone walls, the kind of silence that dared you to make a sound</em>.</p>
<p><em>Sound: Small steps of Emma’s shoes and the quiet morning of a Tuesday.</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong><em>(Whispers to herself)</em><strong> </strong>What is going on today? It was perfectly fine yesterday…</p>
<p>(She approaches a tiny group filled with other juniors.)</p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong>Hi</p>
<p>(The group looks at her, and they ignore her)</p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong><em>: (confident</em>) School doesn’t feel like school anymore.</p>
<p><em>(The group look at her again, but </em><strong>BECKY</strong> <em>says something)</em></p>
<p><strong>BECKY</strong>: Yeah. Anyways….</p>
<p><em>(The group leaves her, walking to the cafeteria)</em></p>
<p><em>(</em><strong>EMMA</strong><em> decided to say hello to her teacher since no one was responding to her.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong>Good morning, Mr. Adlam!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> ADLAM:<em> </em></strong><em>(blunt tone)</em> Good morning Emma.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EMMA:</strong> What are we learning today?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> ADLAM:</strong> We wont.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>(The weird tone in Mr. Adlam’s voice spooked Emma, as if there is something wrong with her)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong>: <em>(worried)</em> I…I don’t understand.</p>
<p><em>(Emma walked to another classroom, expecting to see her cheery science teacher to say something </em>normal<em>.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA<em>:</em></strong><em> (trying to be cheerful with all the confusion) </em>Hi Mrs. Burkins! What are we learning today?</p>
<p><strong>MRS. BURKINS</strong>: <em>(Same dry tone as Mr. Adlam)</em> You will see.</p>
<p><em>(</em><strong>MRS. BURKINS</strong> <em>immediately left her in the hallway, closed and locked her door.)</em></p>
<p>(<strong>EMMA </strong><em>started to really worry now. But luckily, she sees her best friend </em><strong>RAIN</strong><em> in the hallways)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA:</strong> I’m having a bad morning, Rain.</p>
<p><strong>RAIN</strong>: (<em>blunt</em>) Ok.</p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong>: (<em>whispers quietly to herself</em>) What is going on with people!</p>
<p><strong>RAIN</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong><em>: (didn’t hear it)</em> Rain? Are you okay? You’re never like this!</p>
<p><strong>RAIN</strong>: You are being schizophrenic. I’m. always. like. <em>this.</em></p>
<p><em>(Sound: Eerie screeching)</em></p>
<p><em>(</em><strong>RAIN’s</strong><em> cried black ink, </em><strong>EMMA</strong><em> had an instinct to run.)</em></p>
<p><em>(</em><strong>EMMA</strong><em> ran as fast as she could. The bell rang soon after that.)</em></p>
<p><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT SPEAKER</strong>: <em>(faint worry in their voice)</em> Attention Emerson High students. This is not a drill. Code Lockdown. I repeat, code Lockdown.</p>
<p><em>(</em><strong>EMMA</strong><em> quickly walked towards her homeroom.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Her homeroom was in the third floor of the school. She </em><em>climbed a flight of narrow steps from the second floor)</em></p>
<p><em>(A strange figure is shown as <strong>EMMA</strong> gets closer to her classroom door. The lights flicker on and off, as if the third floor was haunted)</em></p>
<p><em>(Sound: Light buzz)</em></p>
<p>(<em>Students rushed one by one into the classroom. </em><strong>MAX</strong><em> and </em><strong>BECKY</strong><em> seemed unbothered, as if this was a drill.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong>: Max..</p>
<p><strong>MAX:</strong> <em>(flat tone</em>) Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong>: <em>(scared)</em> Do you wonder why we have a lockdown?</p>
<p><strong>MAX:</strong> We got a threat by this <u>unknown figure</u></p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong>: Unknown figure ? Like a mythologic creature?</p>
<p><strong>MAX:</strong> I think. It might not be. Or it could be just an identified person.</p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong>: <em>(starting to get angry over him being calm</em>) And this doesn’t bother you?</p>
<p><strong>MAX:</strong> Pretty much.</p>
<p>(<strong>EMMA</strong><em> stopped talking and heard a noise up from the ceiling.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA</strong>: Do you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>MAX:</strong> Hear what?</p>
<p>(<em>Sound: Aggressive mysterious noise from the ceiling)</em></p>
<p><em>(She looked around the room. Maybe </em><strong>BECKY</strong><em> heard it.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong><em>(stressed)</em> Becky…do you hear that.</p>
<p><strong>BECKY:</strong> No. I don’t hear anything. You are such a delusional freak.</p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong>You don’t hear anything?! What is going on! Max? Please tell me you-</p>
<p><em>(Emma gasped at the sight of his blood on the floor, dripping away from the door, forming footstep-like clue)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong>Max..?</p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong><em>(uncomfortable)</em><strong> </strong>Mr. Keys, a student is gone! Look, it’s his blood. Mr. Keys?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> KEYS: </strong>Nothing is wrong with Max. He went to the bathroom.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong>But you aren’t <em>supposed to </em>go to the bathroom at lockdown! Why would you let him go?</p>
<p>(<em>Silence filled the classroom longer than the scattered talking.)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong><em>(thinking) </em>Can I go?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> KEYS: </strong><em>(eerie tone) </em>Go quickly. Be careful or <em><u>they will see you</u></em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong><em>(unlocks door) </em>Thank you.</p>
<p>(<em>She follows the red path to doom. She needed answers. No one was answering her.)</em></p>
<p><em>(Sound: Rapid, soft footsteps)</em></p>
<p><em>(She finds a tall, </em><strong>UNKNOWN FIGURE</strong><em> who is dragging a body away, smearing blood around the marble floor down the main hall)</em></p>
<p><strong>EMMA: </strong>Max…</p>
<p>(<em>Blackout)</em></p>
<p><strong>END.</strong></p>
