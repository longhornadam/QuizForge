<h1>Before First Period (Adaptation - Major): William Laird</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>Interior: school</p>
<p>Characters: Carlos (12), Charlie (13), Mr. Miles (30s), Principal Hall (50s)</p>
<p>(Carlos arrives at school earlier than usual.)</p>
<p>CARLOS: (To himself) Ahhh finally, it's Friday. Just one more school day. Should've brought my jacket, it's a bit cold.</p>
<p>(He walks down the hall to his class.)</p>
<p>(Sound: echos of normal school sounds.)</p>
<p>(Carlos spots his friend Charlie with a group of other kids)</p>
<p>CARLOS: What's up Charlie.</p>
<p>(Carlos dabs up Charlie)</p>
<p>CHARLIE: (Robot like) Hi, Carlos.</p>
<p>CARLOS: (Confused) Uhh, okay. So wha-</p>
<p>CHARLIE: (Rushing) We have to go.</p>
<p>CARLOS: (Still questioning himself) Okay then. Bye.</p>
<p>(Carlos keeps heading down the hallway when he spots Mr. Miles.)</p>
<p>CARLOS: Good morning Mr. Miles.</p>
<p>MR. MILES: (In the same tone as Charlie) Good morning Carlos.</p>
<p>(Carlos smiles faintly as they walk past each other, wondering what just happened.)</p>
<p>CARLOS: (To himself) What is happening today. I guess nobody is happy for the weekend.</p>
<p>(He continues down the hall and turns the corner and sees Mr. Miles)</p>
<p>CARLOS: Good morning Mr. Mi-</p>
<p>MR. MILES: Good morning Carlos.</p>
<p>(Carlos stops dead in his tracks as "Mr. Miles" turns the corner.)</p>
<p>CARLOS: Weren't you just over there.</p>
<p>(Mr. Miles speeds off.)</p>
<p>Okay, something is up.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, Principal Hall comes on the speakers.)</p>
<p>PRINCIPAL HALL: STUDENTS, THERE HAS BEEN A CODE BLACK, I REPEAT, CODE BLACK.</p>
<p>(For some reason, all of the teachers exited their classrooms and began their way to the office in some kind of order. All of the students were bunching up in classrooms like they knew what was going on.)</p>
<p>CARLOS: What is happening.</p>
<p>(The hallway became silent, with nowhere to go, Carlos became terrified.)</p>
<p>CARLOS: (with tears in his eyes) No no no no no NO!</p>
<p>(Lights cut to black.)</p>
