<h1>Before First Period (Adaptation - Major): Miguel Rivero</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>(sounds, quiet, barely any sounds)</p>
<p>Narrator: Jack arrived at school earlier than usual. The building looked exactly the same as it always did, but the quiet felt heavier than normal.</p>
<p>Jack, (to self) “Dang, why is everything so… quiet”</p>
<p>Narrator, Jack passed a small group of other students and spoke to them.</p>
<p>Jack, do y’all know why everything is so quiet?</p>
<p>Students, (in a calm voice, at the same time) today is different</p>
<p>Jack, (to students) “why”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Narrator, the other students walked away. Like if they did not want to say something.</p>
<p>Narrator: A few steps later, the student saw the first teacher of the day, coach Beckham. Expecting the usual greeting or routine behavior, Jack spoke first.</p>
<p>Jack (in a cheerful tone) “Hi coach Beckham!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Coach Beckham (in a robotic tone) “Hello Jack, have a nice day.”</p>
<p>Jack, (walking away), (in a confused tone) “That was odd”</p>
<p>Narrator, Jack continued walking and tried to calm themself by focusing on a familiar routine. For a moment, this helped. Everything still looked normal, and the other students seemed unconcerned.</p>
<p>Narrator, Then Jack encountered coach Beckham again, but farther down the hall, which was impossible. Because he was farther down the hall in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Jack, (confused) “how...how did he get here?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Jack (to Coach Beckham) how did you get there without walking past me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Coach Beckham, “Hello Jack, have a nice day”.</p>
<p>Narrator, now, Jack knew something was wrong.</p>
<p>As Jack reacted, a school announcement interrupted. The voice over the loudspeaker sounded calm but serious and said instruction meant to keep them safe.</p>
<p>Principal’s loudspeaker: “students, all the teachers today are not feeling well, if you see a teacher, don’t look at their eyes.”</p>
<p>Narrator, Jack spoke again, realizing that this was not going to end well.</p>
<p>Jack, “whatever this is, I’m cooked!”</p>
<p>Narrator, What Jack did not understand was that the teachers were no longer acting as individuals, while the other students were already being guided away.</p>
