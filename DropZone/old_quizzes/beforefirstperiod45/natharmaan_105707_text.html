<h1>Before First Period (Adaptation - Major): Armaan Nath</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p><strong>Interior: Empty hallway in Baines Middle School, early morning. Jackson (13) walking down an empty hallway to the gym, with his basketball shoes in hand.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>(Sound: Net swishes in the gym. Shoes squeak in the distance.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jackson</strong>: (quietly) Who is in the gym this early?</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:&nbsp;</strong>(walks to the gym) Mr. James what are you doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. James:&nbsp;</strong>(startled) Umm just fixing up the rim for the tournament today.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson</strong>: (confused) Ok.</p>
<p><em>(Mr. James runs out of the gym.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jackson: </strong>(scared) I'm going to go to first period.</p>
<p><em>(Jackson stops and talks to a group of kids he saw)</em></p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> (to group of kids) Have you noticed anything wrong with Mr. James?</p>
<p><strong>Group of kids:&nbsp;</strong>(lying) No he seems normal.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:&nbsp;</strong>Ok, see y'all later.</p>
<p><em>(Jackson goes looking for Mr. James)</em></p>
<p><strong>Mr. James:</strong> Jackson will never know my plan to sabotage the basketball tournament.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Mr. James has always been a weird guy.</p>
<p>(Announcements start and Mr. James sounding calm but serious says "WHO'S READY FOR THE BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT"? After the announcements end the classroom gets weirdly quiet. Then Jackson goes to the restroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:&nbsp;</strong>Why is the room so quiet?</p>
<p><em>(Jackon notices something wrong. Then Mr. James enters the room and the class goes silent.)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Mr. James: (weirdly) What's up class?</p>
<p>(Jackson notices that adults aren't acting like adults)</p>
<p>Jackson: (quiet, scared) Class?</p>
<p>(Mr. James tilts his head. His smile widens)</p>
<p>(Sound: All the students turn their heads at once toward JACKSON. Their faces are blank.)</p>
<p>(Blackout.)</p>
