  <p><strong>Drama Version: "Before First Period"</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interior: School hallway, early morning. Marcia (14) walks along a back hallway with her books clutched in her arms protectively.</strong></p>
<p><em>(Sound: Lockers clanging in the distance. Footsteps echo.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcia:&nbsp;</strong><em>(quietly - to self)</em>&nbsp;Why does it feel so empty?</p>
<p><em>(Marcia saw a group of students and excitedly ran towards them, she didn’t want to continue feeling alone.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcia<em>:</em></strong><em> (as cheerful as possible)</em> Hi, what is your first period class, and are you excited to learn?</p>
<p><em>(The group of students ignored her except for one tall guy, who looked like the leader of their group.)</em></p>
<p><strong>The tall guy:</strong> (hurried tone) Nonya (walks away quickly)</p>
<p><em>(He spoke as if he didn’t want to interact with anyone, but Marcia continued talking anyway.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcia:</strong> That’s cool, do you want to walk with ---</p>
<p><em>(The tall guy was gone before Marcia could even complete her question. Marcia felt rejected, but she continued walking. After a minute or so, Marcia saw a teacher, Ms. Planch.</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcia: </strong><em>(happily)</em> Hi, good morning!</p>
<p><em>(Ms. Planch stared at Marica for a second but then answered with a blank expression.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Ms. Planch:</strong><em> (blankly with a dull tone)</em> Good morning. (walks away)</p>
<p><em>(Marcia was very surprised because, usually most teachers wave at her and engage her in a conversation. Marica took a deep breath, trying to calm herself. It worked. Every student around didn’t look like they noticed anything different, they were all unconcerned.)</em></p>
<p><em>(As Marcia continued walking, she saw another teacher. Marcia hoped that the reaction would be better from this teacher.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcia:</strong> <em>(tone: hopeful)</em> Hi Mr. Brick! How are you doing this morning?</p>
<p><em>(Mr. Brick reacted the same way Ms. Plach did, with a blank look on his face.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Mr. Brick:</strong> <em>(no emotion)</em> Same way I did last morning. <em>(Shuts the door to his classroom in her face)</em></p>
<p><strong>Marcia: </strong><em>(tense)</em> ok</p>
<p><em>(Something wasn’t right. Just as Marcia was going to ask another question to Mr. Brick, there was a school announcement that came onto the microphone. The voice sounded calm, but serious. She realized it was her principal, Ms. Berezniki.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Ms. Berezniki:</strong><em> (loudly over the speaker)</em> Hello. For your safety, I would recommend following the teachers outside the school grounds. (ends call abruptly)</p>
<p><em>(There was no explanation about what they needed to stay safe from, or why, suddenly, the students needed to be escorted out of the building. It suddenly became very quiet. Everyone looked calm. Too calm. Marcia looked like the only one who was panicking. Marcia realized that something was terribly wrong.)</em></p>
<p><em>(As the students were walking out of the building, Marcia noticed that the teachers were walking like robots, as if they were being controlled by something, or maybe SOMEONE.)</em></p>
<p><strong>THE END</strong></p>
