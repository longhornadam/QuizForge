<h1>Before First Period (Adaptation - Major): Julia Hernandez</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>Interior: Maya (13) pulling up to school. Entering the school earlier than usual. Maya is firmly gripping on her backpack anxiously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Sound: Ac system running loud in the background. Scattered voices echoing further down the hallway.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Maya: (to self) Just another boring day at school. Right?</p>
<p>&nbsp; (Maya walks through the main hallway meeting other students in the hall)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Maya: Hi there! Are you guys new because, I don't know where my-</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Their voices overlap)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Trey: Heyy, we aren't new. Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Bria: Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp; Tony: (confused) Hi?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Tiana: Why are you asking us?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Maya: (annoyed because interrupted) I don't know where my first class is.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (And the students just walked of not having a single care about what Maya needed help on)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Maya: (confused, upset, and sarcastic) Oh well, bye to you too. Nice talk, I guess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(There footsteps, laughter, and gossip fades away as they walk down the hallway.)</p>
<p>Maya: (cuts into another hallway to walk away from the group) AHHH! Sorry, you scared me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Coach Tim: (wierdly speaks) Oh. I don't mean any harm! You weren't thinking I was going to do anything to you. Right? I mean I would never?!?</p>
<p>Maya: (thinks in her head) This guy is a creep! I knew my sister was right when she told me this school is weird. I should have believed her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Coach Tim: (walks back to his class) Goodbye. MAYA!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Maya: (stares down the empty hallway) Wait... How- how- did you know m- my- umm name?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Maya walks back around to try and navigate where her first period class was, already wanting this day to be over. Everyone around her seemed calm and relaxed, so why wasn't she? Maya just couldn't his face out of her head. He seemed so lifeless and blank, as if his mind was blank and his eyes were empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Maya: (turns into a hallway she hasn't already seen) Yes! Finally, my first period class.</p>
<p>(Maya expected to be happy and relaxed once she found her class. Except that the teacher had the same empty dark eyes, with the same blank and unhinged smile that spread from one side of his face to the other.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Maya: (contemplating whether she should go inside the class.) Uhhhhh</p>
<p>&nbsp;(Sound: "You weren't thinking I was going to do anything to you. Right? I mean I would never?!?" playing back and forth in her head.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;(The sound of Coach Tim's voice sent a shiver down her spine. His voice felt like it was banging down her head until she couldn't handle it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Maya: (turns back around and begins running away) This can't be happening! It just can't be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(She thought she was free until she bumped into a figure. She looked down at the floor to scared to see who it was.)</p>
<p>Maya: (sweat dripping down her face while mumbling) There is no shadow.</p>
<p>Coach Tim: Maya there is nothing to fear! Just go back to class and all will be well.</p>
<p>(Maya slowly walks down the hallway with a face of terror as she walks into her first period class, because she was forced by Coach Tim. As she walks in the class, she notices that everyone had the same face that had fear and death written all over it. The blank eyes and the smile that spread out as far as the eye could see.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Maya:(looks over to the back of the class)</p>
<p>(It was a teacher so identical to Coach Tim, Maya almost thought she was hallucinating.)</p>
<p>Maya: (horrified) You?!? How... you were in the hallway. I thought you were gone!</p>
<p>Coach Timmy Tuff Knuckles: (Smile spread across his face) You can never escape me. But don't worry I would never hurt you! Right?</p>
<p>Maya: (screaming to the class) You guys we have to get out of here! we need to-</p>
<p>Announcement: (static and glitched) This is your principal speaking! FIND SAFETY AND EVACUATE FROM THE BIULDING! GO NOW! Find the- and- go- NOW!</p>
<p>Maya: (Looks toward the class)</p>
<p>(The same smile. The same blank expression. The same pale face)</p>
<p>Coach Timmy Tuff Knuckles: You really thought this is your actual 1st period class. You think your safe? Don't worry, I would never harm you. Right!?!</p>
<p>THE END</p>
