Read the passage carefully before answering.\n\n**The Gift of Time**\n\nEmma sat at her grandmother's bedside, watching the afternoon sunlight stream through the hospital window. Her grandmother's hands, once quick and strong from years of gardening, now rested quietly on the white blanket. Emma held one of those hands gently, noticing how thin and papery the skin had become.\n\n\"Tell me about the garden,\" Emma said softly.\n\nHer grandmother's eyes brightened. \"Oh, the roses are probably blooming now,\" she said, her voice weak but warm. \"The red ones by the fence—I planted those the year you were born. Every time I see them, I think of you.\"\n\nEmma felt tears prick her eyes. She had been so busy with school and friends that she hadn't visited the garden in months. Now, sitting here, she realized how much time she had wasted. The homework assignments and social media posts that had seemed so important suddenly felt meaningless.\n\n\"I'm sorry I haven't been around more,\" Emma whispered.\n\n\"Hush now,\" her grandmother said, squeezing Emma's hand with surprising strength. \"You're here now. That's what matters. We don't get to choose how much time we have, but we can choose what we do with the time we're given.\"\n\nThat evening, as Emma walked through her grandmother's garden, she noticed things she had overlooked before: the way the evening light made the rose petals glow, the sound of bees humming among the lavender, the sweet scent of jasmine on the breeze. She pulled out her phone, not to scroll through messages, but to take photos—not for posting online, but for remembering.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Emma visited every day. Sometimes they talked; sometimes they just sat together in comfortable silence. Emma learned to treasure these quiet moments, understanding now that love isn't measured in grand gestures but in simple presence.\n\nWhen her grandmother passed away peacefully one morning, Emma felt profound sadness, but also gratitude. She had been given a gift—the gift of time—and she had chosen to use it well. Standing in the garden at the funeral, surrounded by the blooming roses her grandmother had planted, Emma made a promise to herself: she would never again take for granted the precious, fleeting moments she had with the people she loved."
