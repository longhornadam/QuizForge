Type: ORDERING
Prompt:

2. letter
3. in
4. word
5. :
---
Type: MA
Prompt:
Select all the code snippets that show a syntactically correct first line of a for loop.
Choices:
- [x] for i in range(1, 10):
- [ ] for i in range(1, 10)
- [x] for char in "hello":
- [ ] for i: range(10)
- [ ] for i in range 1, 10:
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
What is the primary purpose of the loop variable, like index in for index in range(1, 5):?
Choices:
- [ ] To count how many times the loop has run and nothing else.
- [ ] To store the final result of the loop's calculations.
- [x] To hold the current value from the data sequence for each iteration.
- [ ] To determine if the loop should continue running.
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
Examine the following code. Why will it not work as intended?

word = "test"
for letter in word:
print(letter)

Choices:
- [ ] The variable word is not a valid data type for a loop.
- [ ] The print() function cannot be used inside a loop.
- [x] The loop body (the print statement) is not indented.
- [ ] The variable letter was not declared before the loop.
---
Type: MC
Prompt:
How does a for loop know when to stop when iterating over a string like "hello"?
Choices:
- [ ] It stops when it sees the letter "o".
- [ ] It runs forever until the user stops it.
- [x] It runs once for each character and stops automatically after the last one.
- [ ] It requires a stop command inside the loop body.
---
Type: CATEGORIZATION
Prompt:
Categorize each code snippet based on whether it iterates over a string or a numeric range.
Categories:
- Iterates over a String
- Iterates over a Numeric Range
Items:
- for c in "Python": => Iterates over a String
- for num in range(50): => Iterates over a Numeric Range
- for i in range(1, 101): => Iterates over a Numeric Range
- name = "Ada Lovelace"; for char in name: => Iterates over a String

Type: FILEUPLOAD
Prompt:
Below is a broken Python program. It is supposed to ask the user for a positive integer and calculate its factorial using a for loop. It contains **two errors**, both directly related to concepts taught in Lesson 1 (loop colons, loop ranges, indentation rules).

YOUR TASK:
1. Create a new text file named **yourname_fix_factorial.txt**.
2. Copy the code below into that file.
3. Fix the two errors.
4. Save the file.
5. Upload your corrected TXT file here.

BROKEN CODE TO FIX:

# fix_factorial.py
# GOAL: This program should calculate the factorial of a user-input number.
# TASK: Find and fix the two errors in the code below.

num = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
factorial = 1

# The loop below has errors.
for i in range(1, num)
    factorial = factorial * i

print("Factorial =", factorial)

===RATIONALES===
---
Q1:
The lesson defines iteration as the act of repeating something. Repeating a block of code multiple times is called iteration, not declaration or assignment.
---
Q2:
In Python, a for statement must end with a colon (:) to indicate the start of the indented loop body; semicolons and commas are not used that way.
---
Q3:
The indented block that repeats inside a loop is called the loop body.
---
Q4:
Iterating over "cup" prints c, then u, then p on separate lines.
---
Q5:
range(1, 5) produces 1–4, so total becomes 10.
---
Q6:
range(1, 6) is needed to generate 1–5.
---
Q7:
Indentation defines which statements are inside the loop.
---
Q8:
The variable name i is commonly used for loop indices.
---
Q9:
Correct order: for letter in word :.
---
Q10:
Only syntactically valid loop headers ending with a colon are correct.
---
Q11:
The loop variable holds the current value each iteration.
---
Q12:
print(letter) must be indented to be inside the loop.
---
Q13:
A for loop stops automatically after the last character.
---
Q14:
String loops iterate characters; range() loops iterate numbers.
