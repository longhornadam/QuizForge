Maple Court was usually loud at dusk, dogs barking, sprinklers clicking, kids arguing over bikes. Tonight it sounded empty, like someone had muted the world.\n\n**[2]** She stepped onto the sidewalk to bring in the trash cans when a paper scrap skittered to her shoe. It was folded tight like a warning, and written in blocky pen it said: IF YOU SEE HIM RUN HIDE DO NOT TRUST ANYONE. The message was so short it felt unfinished, like a sentence cut off before the worst part.\n\n**[3]** Mira looked up. At the end of the street the neighbor who always watered his lawn at dusk stood in the middle of the road smiling. He lifted one hand, as if he were waving her closer. Behind him, every house window was dark except one, the Goodman place, where a single lamp flickered."

If she saw him, should she run and then hide? Or if she saw him run, should she hide immediately? The difference felt like life and death, but the note refused to explain itself.\n\n**[7]** Mira reached the old gate by the alley it opened on its own with a wet click. Cold air slid out, smelling of rain even though the sky was clear. The neighbor at the end of the street turned his head toward her, and his smile did not change.\n\n**[8]** Mira stepped through. She did not look back. Behind her, someone called softly \"Mira come here,\" and the words sounded almost kind."
