Paragraphs are numbered.\n\n**High-Fantasy Suspense Passage (Capitalization Draft With Problems)**\n\n**[1]** At midnight the last bell of thornwatch keep rang once and then went silent. Elowen pulled her cloak tighter and watched the fog collect between the standing stones like breath trapped in a throat.\n\n**[2]** The old map said the path would open only for a sworn messenger of the crown. Elowen was not sworn, not anymore, but the seal in her pocket still burned against her palm as if it remembered the king's hand.\n\n**[3]** A whisper slid through the heather: return it to the vault. The words did not sound like wind, they sounded like a person choosing each syllable. Elowen turned toward the ruins and saw a lantern moving where no traveler should be.\n\n**[4]** On the gate of black iron, a sign hung crooked. it read: enter, and be judged. She should have laughed at such a warning, but the letters looked freshly written, wet as ink, and the air tasted of cold metal.\n\n**[5]** The lantern stopped. A figure stood behind it, tall and patient, with a hood that hid the face. When the figure spoke, the voice was calm, almost kind: \"i know what you carry, Elowen.\"\n\n**[6]** Her name in a stranger's mouth made the night feel narrower. She stepped back, and the fog stepped with her, as if it listened. In her mind she heard the court mage's last instruction: do not speak to the warden.\n\n**[7]** Elowen had never met the Warden, but every story in the keep treated the title like a blade. Some called him the warden of oaths, others called him the Warden, and the difference suddenly mattered.\n\n**[8]** The hooded figure lifted a hand, palm up, as if offering mercy. \"Give the seal to the Crown,\" he said, and the word crown sounded like an order, not a person. Behind him, the iron gate opened without a sound."
