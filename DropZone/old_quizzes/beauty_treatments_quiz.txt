Read the following passage about popular beauty treatments and their uses.

Professional beauty treatments have evolved significantly over the past decade, offering solutions for everything from fine lines to hair removal. Botox and dermal fillers remain among the most popular non-surgical procedures, designed to smooth wrinkles and restore volume to the face. Meanwhile, laser treatments have become a go-to solution for removing unwanted hair, treating acne scars, and improving skin texture.

Microneedling and chemical peels represent two different approaches to skin rejuvenation. Microneedling uses tiny needles to trigger the skin's natural healing response and boost collagen production, while chemical peels use acids to dissolve the outer layers of skin. Both procedures require downtime and proper aftercare to prevent complications.

Eyebrow treatments like microblading and powder brows have transformed how people approach brow design. Microblading creates hair-like strokes, while powder brows provide a softer, filled-in appearance. Both are semi-permanent procedures lasting 18-24 months and require annual touch-ups to maintain their appearance.

Threading, waxing, and dermaplaning offer quick, non-invasive options for hair removal and exfoliation. Threading is ideal for precise facial hair removal, especially around the eyebrows and upper lip. Dermaplaning removes fine facial hair (peach fuzz) while simultaneously exfoliating dead skin cells, leaving skin smooth and radiant.
